<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> author puts forth this little book
of actual adventures in the great
new land of Alaska with the hope
that it will afford healthy-minded young
people a true idea of some phases of human
and animal life there. These stories are
picked out of an experience of forty years
and selected with a view to both unity and
variety.</p>

<p>The first three chapters are an attempt to
draw in bold outline some dramatic episodes
of the author's experience in the second of
the three great gold stampedes of the Northwest.
All these struggles for gold have in
them richly dramatic elements. Life in
such camps pulses strongly with all human
ambitions, affections and passions. The
missionary, if he is really to commend himself
to the men who rush into the wilderness
for gold, and do them good, must, first of
all, prove himself a <em>man</em>, ready and able to do
and suffer everything that falls to the lot of
the gold seekers. He must live their life
and play the game with them. He must
cheerfully put up with the privations they
endure, must take the lead in their healthy
sports, must alleviate their sufferings, and,
keeping himself free from the deadly
gold-lust, must show that he has in himself and
can give to his fellow pioneers something
better than gold. His heart must be, for
himself and those about him, a living
fountain of joy and peace.</p>

<p>As in his earlier work, "The Klondike
Clan," the author endeavored to draw a true
picture not only of the life and conditions
of the first Northwestern gold-rush, but also
of the minister's aims and field of duty; so in
this short sketch of the second Stampede his
aim has been, above all things, <em>truth</em>. Every
incident is actual history, and even the
names are real. The dog story is also
conscientiously true history, and belongs to
one of the minor gold stampedes.</p>

<p>The second section of the book&mdash;the three
bear stories and the walrus story&mdash;are also
bits of history. Every pioneer missionary
in Alaska should be an ardent hunter. The
author's life has often depended upon his
gun and fishing tackle. For ten years in
Southeastern Alaska he and his family had
no beef or pork or mutton, but the game&mdash;animals,
birds and fish&mdash;more than made up
for the lack of these.</p>

<p>In Interior Alaska the same conditions
prevail. The wild animals furnish not only
the food of the people, both natives and
whites, but also their winter clothing. Life
would be unbearable there in "sixty-below
weather" were the inhabitants unable to
procure the warm coats provided by kindly
Mother Nature for the use both of her
four-footed and her human children.</p>

<p>The Eskimo faces the hardest conditions
of almost any native race in his battle for
life; and yet he is, perhaps, the most
comfortable of any. He gets his living from the
Arctic seas, the seal and walrus being his
main dependence. From the great walrus
he gets meat, clam chowder, light and fuel;
its skin makes his foot-wear, the walls and
roof of his house, and his boats; its ivory
furnishes his tools and implements of the
chase. When the author and his friends
brought the great supply of walrus meat to
the Eskimo village of East Cape they insured
the life and comfort of its inhabitants
for the winter. All this is an essential part
of a missionary's beneficent work. Good
service for God and humanity is not
inconsistent with the joy of the chase.</p>

<p>As the author confidently expects that
many of his young readers will find their
permanent homes in "The great big, broad
land 'way up yonder," he hopes this book
may prove, in some degree, an introduction
to the enjoyments and achievements of the
life there.</p>

<h2><a name="ChI" id="ChI">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>THE NOME STAMPEDE</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">t</span> was with the excitement of a veteran
soldier going into a fresh battle that I
teetered over the springy plank from
the Rampart shore to the deck of the Yukon
River steamboat. My year's outfit of "grub
and duds," as the miners would put it, was
aboard. I grasped the hand of Dr. Koonce,
with whom I had just floated in an open boat
down the Yukon twelve hundred miles. A
fine fellow&mdash;"Kooncie"! We had been
camping, and fishing, and packing, and boating
together since the first of May, 1899, and
it was now the middle of August. He was
to stay at the new mining town of Rampart,
build a church there and learn the joyous
life of a pioneer missionary.</p>

<p>What a queer mix-up of men on the
crowded decks of the steamboat! Wild
rumors of a ridiculous sort had reached the
ears of gold hunters clear up the two thousand
miles of the swift and crooked Yukon
to Dawson. Gold! Not snugly reposing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the frozen gravel of deep gulches and
canyons cut through the high hills&mdash;where
respectable and orthodox gold ought to be;
but gold on the wind-swept, stormy, treeless,
exposed coast of Seward Peninsula&mdash;the
tongue that impudent young Alaska
sticks out at old Asia. Gold, like yellow
corn-meal, in the beach-sands of Bering Sea,
where nobody could lawfully stake a claim,
but where anybody could go with shovel,
pan and rocker and gather it up. Nuggets
a-plenty and coarse gold&mdash;enticing shallow
diggings&mdash;in the bed of Anvil Creek and
other creeks and runlets in the hills, and the
flat tundra about Nome.</p>

<p>The reports of the new "strike," often
wild and exaggerated, came as a life-saver
to weary and discouraged thousands of
Klondikers, who had packed their outfits over
the terrible thirty miles of the Chilcoot Pass
in the fall of '97 or the spring of '98, sawed
the lumber themselves in the "armstrong
sawmill," sailed their clumsy boats through
the lakes, shot the rapids of the Upper
Yukon, spent the summer of '98 and the
winter that followed surging here and there
on "wildcat" stampedes or putting down
"dry" holes on unprofitable lays, and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
now eagerly snatching at this new straw,
hoping to "strike it" on the Nome beach.
From Dawson, Forty Mile, Eagle, Circle,
Fort Yukon; from wood camps and
prospectors' tents along the Yukon, and now
from Rampart, these bearded, battered,
sun-blistered men came rushing aboard the
steamboat.</p>

<p>I had engaged a state-room before the
steamboat arrived, but when it came a
placard of the company owning the boat
menaced us in the office: "<em>All reservations
cancelled. Boat overcrowded. No passengers to
be taken at Rampart</em>."</p>

<p>Of course there was a mighty howl from
the Rampart men, nearly half of whom had
packed up to go on the boat. I hurried to
the purser, whom I knew, and showed my
pass from the manager of the company.</p>

<p>"Can't help it, Doctor," he said in a loud
tone, for the benefit of the bystanders.
"The boat's past her limit now, and we're
liable for big damages if anything happens.
We can't take <em>anybody</em>."</p>

<p>Presently he slyly pulled my arm, and I
followed him to an inner office of the store.
"Get your goods aboard," he directed.
"You can spread your blankets on the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
of my office."</p>

<p>While I was checking off my outfit and
seeing it on board, I noticed a lot of the
Rampart men, with hand-trucks gathered
from the various stores, taking their own
outfits aboard, ignoring the shipping clerk
and dumping their goods wherever they
found a place to put them. The officers and
deck-hands were protesting and swearing,
but the men went right along loading their
outfits.</p>

<p>Presently the captain pulled the whistle
rope and ordered the plank drawn in and
the cable cast off from the "dead man."
Instantly three men marched to the cable's
end, seized the man who was to cast it off
and held him. Then fully fifty men with
their packs on their backs filed down the
plank. The first mate tried to stop them.
He even made a move to draw his pistol;
but the foremost man&mdash;a big six-footer&mdash;threw
his arms around him and carried him
back against the stairway and held him until
the men with their packs were all aboard.
It was all done quietly, and with the utmost
good humor. The men grinned up at the
swearing, red-faced captain on the upper
deck, and one shouted, "We'll give you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
poke of dust, Cap., when we get to
Nome."</p>

<p>When all were aboard, somebody on the
bank cast off the cable, the swift current
caught the boat, the wheel backed, and we
swung around and headed down the Yukon,
bound for the new strike.</p>

<p>Whiskers were very much in evidence in
that closely packed mob of men that stood
around on all the decks, stepping on each
other's feet, perching on stairways, boxes,
pole-bunks&mdash;anywhere for a resting place.
To go from one part of the boat to another
was a difficult proposition.</p>

<p>The most evident trait of the crowd was
its good nature. The deck-hands, among
whom I recognized a lawyer friend from
Dawson and a former customs collector
from Juneau, were gold-seekers like all
the rest; and it was, "Hello, Shorty!"
"Ah, there, Dutch!" "Where you goin',
Jim?" between them and the newcomers.
A rollicking, happy-go-lucky crowd, all joyful
at being on the way to the new diggings.
Even the officers of the boat began to smile,
secretly pleased that they had a record-breaking
and most profitable load aboard,
and were free from blame for overloading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
because they could not help it.</p>

<p>As for me, I was well content, even to be
hustled and jostled and elbow-punched by
this horde of scraggly-bearded men of the
northwestern wilderness. This was my
parish, my home; and these were my comrades,
my chums, my brothers. I was just
as sunburned and weather-beaten as they
were, and felt the same tingling of nerves,
the same leap of the blood at the call of
fresh adventure.</p>

<p>I was dressed in the same sort of rough
woolen mackinaw clothes and soft flannel
underwear as the men around me. I had
left my clerical suit and white shirts and
collars behind, for three reasons: First, for
the sake of economy. These strong, loose
garments did not cost a third as much as
broadcloth, and would wear twice as well.
Besides, it would cost a dollar and a half to
have a white shirt laundered in Interior
Alaska (which, at that time, was twice the
original cost of the shirt), and twenty-five
cents to do up a collar, the cost price of
which "outside" was three for a quarter.
I could wash my flannel shirts myself. Second,
for comfort's sake. The soft wool of
these garments was so much warmer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
more pliable than a "Prince Albert" suit;
and a starched collar would sear one's neck
like fire, when it was "sixty below." My
chief reason, however, was that I wished to
create no artificial barriers between my
parishioners and myself. I wished to stand
on the same social level. I desired these
men to feel that I was one of them, and
could camp and "rustle," carry a pack, live
on rabbits and rough it generally as deftly
and cheerfully as they&mdash;live the same outdoor
life and endure the same so-called
"hardships."</p>

<p>The view-point of these "sour-doughs"
was shown in a funny way at our first landing
place after leaving Rampart, which was
the little town of Tanana. When the boat
tied up, the whistle gave three sharp hoots,
showing that the stay would be very short.
As soon as the plank was ashore a man ran
up it, and when he reached the deck he
called loudly: "Is there a preacher aboard?
Is there a preacher aboard?"</p>

<p>A grizzled old miner, who did not know
me, pointed to the only man on the steamboat
who wore a Prince Albert coat and
white shirt and collar, and drawled: "Wa-al,
that there feller, he's either a preacher or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
gambler; I don't know which."</p>

<p>The "dressed-up" man proved to be a
gambler. I made myself known to the
anxious man from the village, followed him
ashore and married him to a woman who
was waiting in the company's office.</p>

<p>That was one voyage of mingled discomfort
and pleasure. Discomforts and hardships
are as you make them and take them.
There were a few of that company who
grumbled and swore at being crowded, at
being obliged to stand up all day, to lie on
the floor or on the piles of cord-wood at
night, besides being compelled to fairly fight
for their meals or to get their food from
their own kits. But the majority of these
men had been camping and roughing it for
two years. Many of them had packed heavy
loads over the Chilcoot Pass in the great
Klondike Stampede, had made their own
boats and navigated hundreds of miles of
unknown and dangerous rivers, had encountered
and overcome thousands of untried
experiences. To all of them these little
discomforts were trifles to be dismissed with
a smile or joke, and they had contempt for
any man who fussed or complained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the cheeriest of the crowd aboard
the steamboat was a newsboy twelve or thirteen
years old. His name was Joe: I never
knew his surname. He had had a very wonderful
time. The year before&mdash;the summer
of 1898&mdash;he was selling papers in Seattle.
He heard of the high prices paid for newspapers
and magazines at the camps of the
Northwest. He bought three or four hundred
copies of the Seattle P. I. (<em>Post Intelligencer</em>)
and <em>Times</em>. He paid two and
a half and three cents apiece for them, the
selling price at Seattle being five cents.
Then he got five or six hundred back numbers
of these papers, from a day to a week
old, for nothing. He also got, mostly by
gift from those who had read them, three
or four hundred of the cheaper magazines,
some new, some a month or two old. For
his whole stock he paid scarcely fifteen
dollars.</p>

<p>Joe smuggled himself and his papers
aboard a steamboat bound for Skagway, and
worked his passage as cabin boy, waiter and
general roustabout. At Juneau and Skagway
he sold about one-fourth of his papers
and magazines&mdash;the papers for twenty-five
cents each and the ten-cent magazines for
fifty cents. He could have sold out, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hearing that he could get double these prices
at Dawson and down the Yukon, held on to
his stock.</p>

<p>He formed a partnership with an old
"sour-dough" miner, who helped him get
his papers over the Chilcoot Pass and down
the Yukon to Dawson. At the great Klondike
camp he quickly sold out his papers at
a dollar each, and the magazines at a dollar
and a half to two and a half.</p>

<p>Joe spent the winter of 1898-9 at Dawson,
selling the two papers published in that city
and running a general news stand, in which
he sold the reading matter he had sold before
but gathered up again from the buyers.
Sometimes he sold the same magazine four
or five times.</p>

<p>When the Nome Stampede began, Joe got
into the good graces of the manager of the
steamboat company and got free passage
down the Yukon. He shared my wolf-robe
on the floor of the purser's room, and we
became great chums. The boy was so
bright and quick, and at the same time so
polite and accommodating, that he made
friends everywhere. He was a Sunday-school
boy, and distributed my little red
hymn-books when I held service in the social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hall of the steamboat on Sunday, and his
clear soprano sounded sweetly above the
bass notes of the men.</p>

<p>"Joe," I asked him one day, "how much
money have you made during the last year
and a half?"</p>

<p>"Well," he replied, "I sent two thousand
dollars out home from Dawson before I
started down here, and with what I am
making on this trip and what I hope to make
at Nome, I think I'll have five thousand
dollars clear when I land at Seattle the last
of October."</p>

<p>"That's a dangerous amount of money
for a small boy to have," I warned him.
"Have you lost any of it?"</p>

<p>Joe grinned. "No, I dassen't. Some
card sharps tried to get me to gamble at
Dawson. They said I could double my
money. But my partner [the old miner]
said he'd lick me half to death if I ever went
near the green tables. I didn't want to,
anyhow. Everybody helps me take care of
my money."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Why, give it all to mother, of course.
She'll use it for me and my sister. I'm
going to school as soon as I get home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Mother works in a store, but I guess this
money'll give her a rest. She needs it."</p>

<p>A word more about little Joe before I
leave him. He made good at Nome in September,
and sailed for Seattle the last of
October. The last I heard of him, four or
five years later, he was making his way
through the University of Washington, and
still managing newspaper routes in Seattle.
His is a case of exceptional good fortune;
and yet I know of a number of boys who
have made remarkable sums selling papers
in Alaska. It is a boy's land of opportunity
as well as a man's.</p>

<p>Our voyage to St. Michael was a tedious
one&mdash;down the long stretches of the Lower
Yukon, worming through the sand-bars and
muddy shallows of the interminable delta,
waiting through weary hours for tide and
wind to be just right before venturing out
on Bering Sea. Hurrying at last under full
steam through the choppy sea, with the
waves washing the lower deck and producing
panic, uproar and swearing among the
men packed upon it&mdash;we came to the harbor
of St. Michael on the wind-swept, treeless,
mossy shore of Norton Sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>I was still to work my way through a
tangle of delays and adventures before I
could reach my goal&mdash;the great new camp
at Nome, one hundred and thirty miles from
St. Michael.</p>

<p>I had first to get my outfit together on the
wharf, counting the boxes and war bags,
pursuing the missing ones to other outfits
and proving my claim to them. In the confusion
this was a hard job, but I only lost
two or three of my boxes. I piled my goods
in a corner of the big warehouse of the
North American Trading and Transportation
Co., and set up my tent on the beach,
for I was near the end of my money, and
could not pay the high prices charged at the
hotels. I got into my camp kit and did my
own cooking, protecting my food as best I
could against the thievish Eskimo dogs.</p>

<p>Then began a search, which lasted a week,
for means of getting to Nome. The gold-hunters
were putting off every day in whale
boats, Eskimo <em>oomiaks</em>, and small sloops and
schooners; but these craft were too small
and uncertain for me to risk passage in
them. My caution proved wise, for five or
six of these small boats, after setting out,
were never heard of again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>While I was waiting, the U. S. Revenue
Cutter, <em>Bear</em>, came into the harbor, and
aboard her was Sheldon Jackson, Superintendent
of Education for Alaska, the noted
pioneer missionary. He was just returning
from a tour of the native schools and reindeer
stations. (He was the man who had
introduced the reindeer into Alaska from
Siberia to supply the wants of the Eskimo.)</p>

<p>"Hurry on to Nome," he counseled me.
"You were never needed more in all your
life."</p>

<p>At length there limped into the harbor a
little tub-like side-wheel steamboat, belonging
to the Alaska Exploration Company,
whose wharf was a mile and a half
distant up the harbor. There was no way
of getting my goods across the swampy
tundra of St. Michael Island to the wharf.
On the beach I found an abandoned old rowboat
with open seams. I procured pieces of
boards, some oakum and pitch, and set to
work to repair the old boat. The steamboat
was to sail for Nome the next forenoon.
I worked all night. I made a pair
of clumsy oars out of boards. Then I carried
my goods to the leaky boat and rowed
them to the dock. It took three trips to
transfer my outfit, and while I was rowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
back and forth somebody carried off my
most valuable war-bag, containing most of
my foot-wear and underclothes&mdash;one hundred
dollars' worth.</p>

<p>I was a tired man when I stumbled down
the steep stairs into the dark and stuffy hold
of the little steamboat; and much more tired
when, after two and a half days of seasickness,
bobbing up and down in the choppy
seas like a man on a bucking broncho, I
pulled up the stairs again and let myself
down the rope-ladder into the dory which
was to take the passengers ashore at Nome.</p>

<p>"You can only take what you can carry
on your back," announced the captain.
"There's a storm coming up and I've got
to hurry to the lee of Sledge Island, twenty
miles away. You'll get your outfits when I
come back. Lucky we're not all down in
Davy Jones's locker."</p>

<p>I strapped my pack-sack, containing my
wolf-robe and a pair of blankets, on my
back, glad to get ashore on any terms. The
dory wallowed heavily in the waves, the
strong wind driving it towards the sandy
beach. Boats have to anchor from one to
two miles offshore at Nome. When we
reached the beach, a big wave lifted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dory and swung it sideways. The keel
struck the sand, and she turned over, dumping
us all out, the comber overwhelming us
and rolling us over and over like barrels.
Drenched and battered, we crawled to
land.</p>

<p>A heavy rain was falling as I staggered
up the beach with my water-soaked blankets
on my back, looking for a lodging-house.
The beach was lined with tents, placed without
regard to order or the convenience of
anybody except the owner of each tent. A
few straggling board-shacks were stuck here
and there on the swampy tundra. Two or
three large, low store buildings represented
the various pioneer trading companies.
The one street, which ran parallel to the
beach, was full of mud. The buildings most
in evidence were saloons, generally with
dance-hall attachments. The absence of
trees, the leaden, weeping sky, the mud, the
swampy tundra, the want of all light and
beauty, made this reception the dreariest of
all my experiences in the new mining camps.</p>

<p>But I long ago learned that nothing is so
bad but that it might be worse. I had not
at that time seen Edmund Vance Cook's
sturdy lines, but the spirit of them was in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
heart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Did you tackle the trouble that came your way<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a resolute heart and cheerful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hide your face from the light of day<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With a craven heart and fearful?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, a trouble's a ton or a trouble's an ounce,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Or a trouble is what you make it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it isn't the fact that you're hurt that counts,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But only, how did you take it!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I soon found a sign written in charcoal on
the lid of a paper box&mdash;<em>Lodging</em>. I entered
the rough building and found a cheery Irish
woman named M'Grath. There was no
furniture in the house except two or three
cheap chairs and a home-made board table.</p>

<p>"Shure, ye can," she answered in reply to
my question about spending the night there.
"Ye'll spread yer robe an' blankets on the
flure, an' it'll only cost ye a dollar an' four
bits. Ye'll plaze pay in advance."</p>

<p>I took stock of the contents of my pocketbook.
There was just five dollars and a
quarter left of the thousand dollars with
which I had started from home on the first
of May. It was now the first of September,
and no more money was due me until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
next spring. My food and tent were on the
steamboat and would not be likely to come
ashore for many days. It was Sunday evening,
and a whole week must elapse before I
could take up a collection.</p>

<p>I paid my landlady and she put my
blankets by her stove to dry. I paid another
dollar and a half for a supper of beans and
flap-jacks&mdash;the first food I had tasted for
three days. I slept soundly that night on
the floor, without a care or anxiety. The
next morning I paid another dollar and a
half for breakfast, and could not resist the
temptation of purchasing a Seattle paper
(only three weeks old&mdash;what a luxury!). I
had just twenty-five cents left&mdash;and I was a
stranger in this strange corner of the earth!</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at my predicament
as I entered the Alaska Exploration
Company's store. A bearded man standing
by the stove bade me "good-morning."</p>

<p>"You seem to be pleased about something,"
he said. "Have you struck it rich?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes!" I replied; "a rich joke on
me," and I told him of the fix I was in.</p>

<p>"What? You are Dr. Young?" he exclaimed,
shaking me heartily by the hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
"Why, I'm a Presbyterian elder from San
Francisco."</p>

<p>The man's name was Fickus, a carpenter,
who had come to Nome to build the store
and warehouses of one of the big companies.
He had held the first religious meetings in
the new camp and had found quite a circle of
Christian people.</p>

<p>He offered to lend me money, but I refused
to take it. "No," I said, "let us wait
and see what happens."</p>

<p>Something happened very quickly. While
we were talking a young man entered the
store and came up to me.</p>

<p>"I understand that you are a minister,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied. "What can I do for
you?"</p>

<p>"You can marry me to the best woman
in Alaska."</p>

<p>"Is she here?" I asked, with a triumphant
smile at Fickus.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she came on the last boat from
Seattle."</p>

<p>"When do you wish the ceremony to take
place?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Right now," he replied. "You can't tie
the knot too quickly to suit me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>I followed the eager young man, married
him to a nice-looking girl who was waiting
in a near-by cabin, received a wedding-fee
of twenty dollars, and returned to my newly-found
friend with the assurance that my
wants were supplied until my outfit would
come ashore.</p>

<p>This was my introduction to the second
great gold camp of the Northwest&mdash;the raw,
crazy, confused stampede of Nome.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="ChII" id="ChII">II</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>THE ANVIL</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="smcap">he</span> first two great gold camps of
the Northwest were very different,
although largely composed of the
same material. In physical features they
were most unlike. The Klondike was in the
great, beautiful, mountainous, forested
Interior; Nome was on the bleak, treeless,
low, exposed coast of Bering Sea. To reach the
Klondike you steamed from Seattle through
twelve hundred miles of the wonderful "Inside
Passage," broke through the chain of
snowy mountains by the Chilcoot Pass, and,
in your rough rowboat, shot down the six
hundred miles of the untamed and untameable
Yukon. Or else you sailed twenty-three
hundred miles over the heaving Pacific
and the choppy Bering Sea to St. Michael,
and then steamed laboriously against the
stiff current of the same Father Yukon
eighteen hundred miles <em>up</em> to Dawson. To
reach Nome you simply steamed the twenty-three
hundred miles of Pacific Ocean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Bering Sea; or, if you were up the Yukon,
came down it to St. Michael and across
Norton Sound a hundred and fifty miles to
Nome.</p>

<p>Though on the same parallel of north
latitude, the climates of the two camps are
very unlike. In the Klondike you have the
light, dry, <em>hot</em> air of summer; the light, dry,
<em>cold</em> air of winter. There are long periods
when the sky is cloudless. In the summer
of unbroken day the land drowses, bathed
in warm sunshine and humming with insect
life, no breath of air shaking the aspens; in
the winter of almost unbroken but luminous
night, the Spirit of the North broods
like James Whitcomb Riley's Lugubrious
Whing-whang,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Crouching low by the winding creeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holding his breath for weeks and weeks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are no wind-storms in the Klondike,
and a blanket of fine, dry snow covers the
land in unvarying depth of only a foot or
two.</p>

<p>On Seward Peninsula, the Spirit of Winter
breathes hard, and hurls his snow-laden
blasts with fearful velocity over the icy
wastes. The snow falls to great depth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
never lies still in one place. It drifts, and
will cover your house completely under in
one night, and pack so hard that the Eskimo
can drive his reindeer team over your roof
in the morning. The air becomes so full of
the flying particles that you cannot see the
lead-dog of your team. Men have lost their
way in the streets of Nome and wandered
out on the tundra to their death. There is
considerable sunshine in the summer, and
some comparatively still days, but there is
much rain, and mossy swamps are everywhere.</p>

<p>The men at Nome in the fall of '99 included
many who had been at Dawson in
'97, but conditions were very different. The
Klondike Stampede was composed of tenderfeet,
not one in twenty of whom had ever
mined for anything before&mdash;men of the city
and village and workshop and farm, new to
wilderness life, unused to roughing it.
Those who reached Nome in '99 were
mostly victims of hard luck. Many were
Klondikers who had spent two winters rushing
wildly from creek to creek on fake reports,
possessing themselves of a multitude
of worthless claims, eating up the outfits
they had brought in with them, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
working for wages in mines of the lucky
ones to buy a passage to the new diggings.
Many had come down the Yukon in their
own rowboats.</p>

<p>But the Klondike Stampede was the cause
of other smaller but more fruitless stampedes.
These were started by steamboat
companies, or by trading companies, and
often by "wildcat" mining companies,
and were generally cruel hoaxes. Scores
of small steamboats, hastily built for the
purpose, went up the Yukon to the Koyakuk
and other tributaries in the summer of '98.
Other scores of power-schooners and small
sailing vessels sailed through Bering Strait
into the Arctic Ocean and through Kotzebue
Sound to the Kobuk and Sewalik Rivers.
Almost without exception these eager
gold-seekers of '98 found only disappointment,
endured the savage winter as best they
could, and, out of money and food, were
making their way back to the States, when
news of the marvelous "beach diggings"
at Nome met them and they flocked thither
in hopes of at least making back their
"grub-stake."</p>

<p>As these vessels approached the new
camp, the most prominent landmark which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
met their eyes was a lone rock in the shape
of an anvil, which crowned the summit of
the highest of the hills near the coast. At
the base of this hill rich gold diggings were
found in a creek. The town which sprung
up was first called Anvil City; but the Government
postal authorities, looking at the
map, found Cape Nome in the vicinity, and
the post-office was named after the Cape.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="anvil" id="anvil"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image4.jpg" width="600" height="365" alt="Anvil Rock, Overlooking Nome" />
</a></div>
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Anvil Rock. Overlooking Nome</p>

<p>For the name "Nome" two explanations
are given. It is said that the American and
Canadian surveyors who were laying out
the projected Western Union Telegraph
Line across the American and Asiatic Continents,
failed to find a name for this cape
and wrote it down "No name," which was
afterwards shortened to Nome. The more
probable explanation is that the surveyors
asked an Eskimo the name of the cape.
Now the Eskimo negative is "No-me," and
the man not understanding, or not knowing
its name said "No-me." This was written
down and put on the map as the name.</p>

<p>But I like Anvil, and spoke and voted for
that name at the first town meeting, held
soon after I landed at the new camp. For
the camp has been a place of hard knocks
from the first. Rugged men have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
there to meet severe conditions and have
been hammered and broken by the blows of
adversity. Others have been shaped and
moulded by fiery trial and "the bludgeonings
of chance." When I see that stone
anvil I think of Tennyson's inspired lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For life is not an idle ore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But iron, dug from central gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And heated hot with burning fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And dipt in baths of hissing tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battered with the shocks of doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shape and use."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I was battered as hard as any one on this
anvil of the Northwest; but to-day I feel
nothing but gratitude for the severe experience.</p>

<p>I had to wait until Saturday before the
little steamer on which I came from St.
Michael returned from the shelter of Sledge
Island and put my goods ashore. In the
meantime I had obtained permission to
spread my blankets on the floor of the
Alaska Exploration Company's store. During
that first week we had constant storms.
Five or six vessels were driven ashore and
broken up by the violence of the waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>But I was getting my congregation together,
and so was happy. A goodly proportion
of Christian men and women are
always found in these gold camps, and they
are very willing workers. Before Sunday
came I had found an old acquaintance,
Minor Bruce, whom I had known fifteen
years before when he was a trader in
Southeastern Alaska. He offered me the use of
the loft over his fur store. Mr. Fickus, the
man from San Francisco, to whom I have
made reference in a former chapter, fixed up
some seats. I got my organ carried up the
ladder and found singers. "Judge" McNulty,
a lawyer friend who was handy with
crayons, made fancy posters out of some
pasteboard boxes I had got from the store.</p>

<p>The floor of Bruce's store was cluttered
with Eskimo mucklucks, bales of hair-seal
skins, and other unsavory articles; and an
old Eskimo woman, who had her lower lip
and chin tattooed downwards in streaks
after the fashion of these people, sat among
the skins, chewing walrus hides and shaping
them into soles for mucklucks, while the
congregation was gathering. One usher received
the people at the store door, steered
them carefully between the bales and skins,
and headed them to another who helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
them up the steep stairway, while a third
seated them. We had a good congregation
and a rousing meeting. Our choir was one
of the best I ever heard. Our organist and
leader was Dr. Humphrey, a dentist, who
had been director of a large chorus and
choir; Mr. Beebe, our chief baritone, had
sung in the choir of St. Paul's Episcopal
Church of Oakland, Cal.; and there were
other professionals. I give these details as
a typical beginning in a frontier camp.
There is always fine talent of all sorts in a
new gold town.</p>

<p>Let me give right here two or three instances
of the bread of kindness "cast upon
the waters" and "found after many days."
Nowhere is this Bible saying oftener realized
than in the friendly wilderness.</p>

<p>One of the first men I met at Nome was
an old Colorado miner, whom I had known
at Dawson. I had done him some kindness
at the Klondike camp during the illness and
after the death of his nephew. When he
found me at Nome he greeted me warmly.
"You're just the man I've been looking for.
I know you don't do any mining, but I'm
going to do some for you. I expect to go
'outside' in a few days. You come out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the tundra with me to-morrow, and I'll stake
some ground for you; then I'll take your
papers out with me and try to sell the
claims."</p>

<p>I went with him and he marked off three
claims for me, which he had already selected.
The next spring, when my long illness had
plunged me deeply into debt and I was wondering
how I could pay my obligations, my
old friend returned with a thousand dollars,
from the sale of one of my claims. I paid
my doctor's bills and the other debts, and
rejoiced. It was as money thrown down to
me from heaven, in my time of dire need.</p>

<p>At Dawson, in the summer of '98, I helped
an old G. A. R. man from Missouri. He
had been sick with the scurvy and was
drowned out by the spring freshets and
driven to the roof of his cabin, where I found
him helpless and half-devoured by mosquitoes.
I raised money for his need and
sent him out home by one of the first steamboats
down the Yukon. Before he left he
pressed upon me the only gift he could
offer&mdash;a fine Parker shotgun. I took this
gun with me when I went to stake my claims
and bagged a lot of ptarmigan; and a number
of times afterwards I shot others of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
these delicious wild chickens with it. And
when I was taken ill and my money all
spent, I was able to sell the gun for a goodly
sum.</p>

<p>One more link in this chain of kindness:
When my goods came ashore and I was able
to set up my tent, I found two men, one a
Norwegian, the other a Michigander, both
of whom had just arrived, without a shelter.
I took them into my tent. They helped me
to move my goods, made me a cot and fixed
up tables, box-chairs and shelves for me.
The Norwegian was a very fine cook and
baked my "shickens" for me most deliciously.
I kept the men in my tent until
they could build a cabin. When I became
ill they would come to see me, bringing
ptarmigan broth and other delicacies; and
when I was convalescing and ravenous the
Norwegian came again and again to my
cabin, bringing "shickens for Mr. Zhung,"
and roasted them for me, serving them with
his famous nut-butter gravy. In the language
of the Northwest, "I didn't do a thing
to those chickens." Of all places in the
world, I think Alaska is most fruitful in
return for little acts of kindness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Men such as I have just described were
pure metal, and the heavy blows they received
on the anvil only made their characters
more beautiful and efficient.</p>

<p>It was in the metal of the men themselves&mdash;what
this hard life would do for them. Some it
made&mdash;some it ruined. Among the "Lucky Swedes,"
who leaped in a few months from poverty to
wealth by the discovery of gold in Anvil Creek,
three form a typical illustration.</p>

<p>One was a missionary to the Eskimos, on
a small salary. At first his gold gave him
much perplexity and trouble while he was
being shaped to fit new conditions; but he
rose finely to the occasion, gave a large part
of his wealth to his church board for building
missions and schools among the natives,
and pursued his Christian way, honored and
beloved, to broader paths of greater usefulness.</p>

<p>A second Swede was also a missionary,
teaching the little Eskimos on a salary of six
hundred dollars a year. His gold completely
turned his head. He fell an easy prey to
designing men and women. He became
dissipated and broken in body and
character. He tried to keep for his own
use the gold taken from the claim he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
staked in the name of his Mission. His
Board sued him for their rights. Long
litigation, in which he figured as dishonest,
selfish and grasping, followed, his church
getting only a small part of its dues. The
last I heard of him he was a mere wreck of
a man, disgraced, despised and shunned by
his former friends. The anvil battering,
the trial by fire, the hard blows, proved him
base metal.</p>

<p>The third man was a Swedish sailor and
longshoreman, ignorant and low, living a
hand-to-mouth, sordid life, with no prospects
of honor or wealth. His gold at first
plunged him into a wild orgy of gambling
and dissipation. He took the typhoid fever
and was taken "outside." Everybody
prophesied that he would simply "go the
pace" to complete destruction.</p>

<p>But there was true steel in his composition.
His moral fiber stiffened. He began
to think and study. He broke away from
his drunken associates. He sought the
companionship of the cultured. A good
woman married and educated him. He has
become one of Alaska's wealthiest and most
influential citizens, and his charities abound.
The stern anvil shaped him to world-usefulness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
It is all in the <em>man</em>!</p>

<p>Here at Nome I first made the acquaintance
of that strange race in which I afterwards
became so much interested&mdash;the
Eskimo. At first they were a source of
considerable annoyance. I always felt like
laughing aloud when the queer, fat, dish-faced,
pudgy folk came in sight. As we had
to depend upon driftwood for our fuel, they
would come several times a day, bringing
huge basketfuls of the soggy sticks for sale
at fifty cents a basket.</p>

<p>They soon learned that I was a missionary,
and then they would come rolling along,
forty or fifty of them at a time, and "bunch
up" in front of my tent. If I were cooking
dinner they were sure to gather in full force,
and would lift up the flap of my tent,
grinning at me and eyeing every mouthful
I ate. I did not know enough of their language
even to tell them to go away. Their
rank native odors were overpowering in the
hot tent. You could detect the presence of
one of those fellows half a mile away if the
wind were blowing from him to you. The
combined smells of a company of natives,
not one of whom had ever taken a bath in
his or her life, and who lived upon ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fish and "ripe" seal blubber&mdash;well, I'll stop
right here!</p>

<p>One evening at a social in our warehouse-church
we played the "limerick" game,
which was then a popular craze. We would
take a word and each one would write a
verse on it. One of the words was Esquimaux.
A number of the "limericks" were
published in the <em>Nome Nugget</em>. With a
man's usual egotism I can only remember
my own, which I saw at intervals for several
years in Eastern periodicals:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, look at this queer Esquimaux!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nose is too pudgy to blaux.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His odors are awful;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To tell them unlawful.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thought of them fills me with waux."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One day I was getting dinner in my tent
and the usual company of natives watching
the performance, when there came along a
couple of men who had just landed and who,
evidently, had never seen an Eskimo before.
I overheard their conversation.</p>

<p>"Say, Jim," said one, "just look there.
Did you ever see the like?" (A pause.)
"Say, do you think them things has souls?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"We-e-ll," drawled Jim, "I reckon they
must have. They're human bein's. But
I'll tell you this: If they do, they've all got
to go to heaven, sure; for the devil'd never
have them around."</p>

<p>Now let me tell you a sequel: Two years
afterwards I was a Commissioner from the
newly organized Presbytery of Yukon to the
General Assembly, which met at Philadelphia.
My fellow Commissioner from the
Presbytery&mdash;the elder who sat by my side&mdash;was
Peter Koonooya, an Eskimo elder from
Ukeavik Church, Point Barrow. Ten years
earlier, Dr. Sheldon Jackson, then Superintendent
of Education for Alaska, had visited
that northernmost point of the Continent
and had started a school and mission. Peter
Koonooya was one of the fruits. He was a
native of extraordinary intelligence, a man
of property, owning a fleet of whaling
<em>oomiaks</em>. He could read, write and talk English,
was a constant student of the Bible, and
was considered by the Presbytery of sufficient
intelligence and piety to represent us
in the supreme Council of the Church.</p>

<p>I am quite certain that Peter always voted
exactly right on all questions which were
up before that Assembly; because he
watched me very closely and voted as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
did.</p>

<p>I was able, then, and in after years, to do
these gentle, good-natured natives some
good, and other Christian teachers have
done much more for them. So it comes
about that the condition of the Alaska
Eskimo, under the influence of the various
Christian missions and schools among them,
as compared with that of their brothers and
sisters of the same race across Bering Strait
in Asia, for whom nothing in a Christian
way has been done, is as day to night. They
are pliable metal, and the Anvil of the
Northwest is shaping them into vessels and
implements of usefulness and honor.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIII" id="ChIII">III</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>BUNCH-GRASS BILL</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">lthough</span> I had often met him on
the streets of Dawson in '98, I had
not come into hand-shaking contact
with Bunch-grass Bill until my first week at
Nome. Of all the social orders whose members
gathered together in clubs for humane
work during the epidemic of typhoid fever,
the first to organize, besides being the
strongest and most active, was the Odd
Fellows' Club. It was already organized
when I arrived and, as I belonged to the
order, I was present at the second meeting.
The young lawyer who was president of the
Club, taking me around the little circle of
earnest men, brought me to a black-haired,
black-eyed, sturdily-built and singularly
handsome young Irishman by the name of
Billy Murtagh.</p>

<p>"Billy owns and runs the 'Beach Saloon,'
and goes by the name of Bunch-grass Bill,"
introduced our president. "I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
how he got into the Odd Fellows, under
rules which bar saloon-keepers and bad
men. But he's in, and we'll not turn him
out of the Club, at least so long as this
distress continues."</p>

<p>Bill made no reply to this rather uncomplimentary
introduction, but shook hands
with Irish heartiness and looked at me with
level gaze. "I've seen you in my saloon at
Dawson," he said.</p>

<p>The others laughed, and the president
chided, "You oughtn't to give a preacher
away like that, Bill."</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at the young man, a
scene at Dawson a year earlier flashed upon
me. I was collecting money to pay the
passage on the steamboat bound down the
Yukon of some poor fellows who were
broken and sick, and who must go "outside"
or die. I made the round of the saloons
and gambling halls, and going into one of
these places was curtly refused by one of the
partners. The other, who was this young
man, came up and quietly said to the cashier,
"Weigh him out two ounces ($32.00)."</p>

<p>"Oh, I remember you now, and your two
ounces," I said to Bill; and to the others,
"I can vouch for his knowing the Second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Degree of the order, at least."</p>

<p>I was made chairman of the Relief Committee
of the Club, and found work a-plenty
cut out for me. Although the members of
the Club did not look with indifference upon
any case of distress, yet its prime object was
to look up and help the sick Odd Fellows.
I prepared a bulletin and tacked it up in the
stores and saloons, directing that any cases
of distress among the members of the order
should be reported to the Committee. As
the typhoid epidemic increased in virulence,
the Club found its hands full.</p>

<p>A day or two after this first meeting, I
was passing Bill's saloon when he called
me in.</p>

<p>"I've just heard of a sick man," he reported,
"and I think he's an Odd Fellow."
Then, after a pause, he added, "But if he
isn't that doesn't make a &mdash;&mdash; bit of difference."</p>

<p>He led the way along the beach for half
a mile or more, to an isolated tent, where
we found the typhoid case. Billy stayed until
he made sure that the man was well cared
for in the charge of friends and a good
physician. Then he took me aside and
slipped a twenty-dollar gold piece into my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
hand. "Use that for him," he directed.</p>

<p>The next day I had to raise a hundred and
fifty dollars to send an old miner who was
poor and crippled "outside." I marched at
once to the "Beach Saloon." "Billy," I
said, "this old-timer has blown in all his
dust for booze; and it's up to you who
have got it from him to take care of him
now."</p>

<p>"That's right," he promptly answered.
"There's ten saloons; what would be my
share?"</p>

<p>"An ounce," I replied, passing him the
paper.</p>

<p>He weighed out the gold dust. "Wait a
while before going on. I'll pass the word
down the line," he said.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterwards I stopped again
at his door. "They're all ready," reported
Bill. "If any of them guys don't come
across, just tell me."</p>

<p>They all "came across," and thereafter,
until I left Nome, all the saloon-keepers met
every demand I made upon them without
question. When a man had been impoverished
or made sick through drink I went to
the saloons, <em>only</em>, for his relief. In
other cases I made a general canvass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
When collecting money for church purposes
I went to everybody, <em>except</em> the saloon-keepers
and their following.</p>

<p>The day before my second meeting with
the Odd Fellows' Club&mdash;a rainy, blustering
day&mdash;I came to Bunch-grass Bill with a
greater demand.</p>

<p>"It is you I want this time, Billy, not just
your money," I said. "There is a sick Odd
Fellow in a tent almost a mile from here.
He is alone and lying in a puddle of water.
Get your gum-boots and find three or four
other stout men and come with me."</p>

<p>Bill agreed at once, found a man to tend
his bar, secured a squad of strong and willing
men, a stretcher from the army post and
a good physician and went with me on the
errand of mercy. He worked all day in the
mud and rain. He carried the sick man to
the warehouse which we had turned into a
temporary hospital, visited all the stores in
an attempt to find mattresses, and, failing
in that, bought eight large reindeer skins
and piled them on the floor for a bed, bought
underwear, dry blankets and other comforts
for the sick man, and laid in a supply of
delicacies for the use of the hospital. In all,
he spent over fifty dollars and a whole day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of strenuous work upon the case.</p>

<p>When I asked him at dusk if he were not
tired he laughed: "Never had a better time
in all my life."</p>

<p>That night was the regular weekly meeting
of the Club. I made my report, which
was quite long, and mentioned many distressing
cases, showing an alarming increase
of the typhoid. Then I asked for a rotary
relief committee of three to be chosen at
every other meeting, and a permanent relief
committee of two.</p>

<p>"I've found the biggest-hearted man in all
Alaska," I said. "His business and mine
are not quite the same. In fact I have been
all my life fighting saloons and saloon-keepers,
and I expect to keep on fighting
them until I die. But this man's heart of
love for his fellow-men fights his business
harder than I can."</p>

<p>Then I related some of the things Billy
had done during the past week, and ended
my speech by asking that he be put on the
permanent relief committee with me. "We
two will find the sick and cut out the work
for the rest of you," I promised.</p>

<p>The Club applauded, much to the confusion
of Bill, who tried his best to shrink out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of sight. One of the boys reported next
morning.</p>

<p>"Say, Doctor," he began, "you sure
scared Bunch-grass Bill near to death last
night. Tickled, too. He asked us all to
come in and have one on him. He doesn't
know anything else to do when he feels
good. 'That's a new one on me,' he said.
'I never had anything to do with a preacher
in my life. Didn't like 'em. Kept shy of
'em. But if Father Young sees fit to come
into my saloon&mdash;and he's in it every day&mdash;I'll
go with him wherever he wants me to
go&mdash;even if it's to his church.'"</p>

<p>That touched me, for I could sense something
of the sacrifice it would involve. It
would be far easier for Bill to start on a
three-thousand-mile winter mush on snow-shoes,
over unbroken trails, than to step inside
of a Protestant meeting-house.</p>

<p>From that time on, Bill was my right
hand. As the number of typhoid victims increased,
he made his saloon an intelligence
office, finding and reporting to me all new
cases. The example of the Odd Fellows
stimulated the various social orders represented
in the camp&mdash;the Masons, Knights
of Pythias, Elks, Eagles, and others&mdash;to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
like humane work; and Bill looked up their
sick members and reported to their committees.
He saw that all the sick had medical
attention, and guaranteed the payment
of scores of doctor's bills. Each steamboat
that left Nome for the "outside" carried a
number of convalescents and broken-down
and moneyless men, and funds had to be
raised for their passage. Bill headed nearly
all of these subscription lists, as well as those
for fitting up the four temporary hospitals
we opened and filled with sick men.</p>

<p>Being for over six weeks the only clergyman
in that whole region, I conducted all
the funerals. One week I had eleven&mdash;all
typhoid cases. Bill attended them all, looking
after the digging of the graves and making
coffins, and often acting as undertaker.</p>

<p>Now, I am not setting up my saloon friend
as a saint. Quite the contrary. I suppose
he had been guilty of every crime mentioned
in the Decalogue. He had never known
any home life, but had knocked about from
camp to camp of the western frontiers ever
since boyhood. His ideas of morality, therefore,
were very vague. He was said to have
been "run out" of several towns in Montana
and Idaho. He had a violent temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and, as the phrase went, was "quick on the
trigger." Rumor said that he had the blood
of more than one man on his hands; although
it was claimed, in every case, that he
had not sought the quarrel. He sold whiskey
and drank it, gambled and swore habitually
without a thought of any of these things
being wrong. He was simply an uncultured,
ignorant, rough-and-ready, Irish-American
backwoodsman.</p>

<p>But to those of us in the raw camp of
Nome who witnessed Bill's untiring kindness
and self-sacrifice during those weeks of
distress, his faults faded into the background
behind the light of his many good deeds.
St. Peter says, "Charity covers a multitude
of sins," and surely Bill's charity
"abounded" overwhelmingly, putting out
of sight much of the evil in his life.</p>

<p>As for me, I shall always think of him as
one of the most loyal, devoted friends I ever
had, and the saver of my life. For after
seven weeks of most strenuous and wearing
work, I was suddenly stricken down with
the typhoid myself. The blow came when
I was fairly drowned in the multitude of my
duties. I was raising the money to send
out on the steamboat four or five men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
must leave the country or die&mdash;poor fellows
whose vitality was so low that they
could not combat the cold and storms of a
Nome winter. I was also preparing another
warehouse-hospital. So great was the
demand for space for the care of the sick
that I had felt compelled to take into my own
ten-by-twelve tent three men sick with the
disease. So crowded was the tent that I
had to sleep under the bed of one of them.
Billy Murtagh and others of the Odd Fellows'
Club warned me against thus exposing
myself to the infection, but there seemed
to be no other way. Billy brought me all
his remaining Apollinaris water that I might
not have to drink the impure seepage of the
tundra. Some of the brothers carried me
pails of water from the one well which had
been recently put down.</p>

<p>While I was in the midst of the canvass
for funds, and in the bustle of preparation
for the departure of the last steamboats, I
had a terrific headache for several days. I
was besieged day and night by friends of
sick men for places to put the stricken ones
where they could be cared for. The life of
a number of these men seemed to depend
on my keeping on my feet. I had no <em>time</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
to be sick. I kept away from Billy and my
other friends, for fear they might forcibly
interfere.</p>

<p>But one of the Odd Fellows saw me as I
was coming out of a store with a subscription
paper in my hand. He looked at me
for a moment and hurried to the "Beach
Saloon."</p>

<p>"Bill," he shouted, "get a doctor, quick,
and go to the parson. I saw him just now
staggering along with his face as red as fire
and his hand to his head. He's got the
fever, sure."</p>

<p>Billy came running down the beach with
Dr. Davy at his heels and caught me as I
was entering my tent. Without ceremony
they picked up the sick man who was in my
cot and carried him to another tent near by.
Then, in spite of my protests, they undressed
me and laid me in my blankets. I was half
delirious and stubborn. I fought them.</p>

<p>"This is all nonsense, Doctor," I protested.
"I have only a headache. There
is no time to fool away. These men must
go out on this steamboat, and the money is
not raised. Let me alone."</p>

<p>Dr. Davy finished his examination and
turned to Bunch-grass Bill. "He has a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
bad case of typhoid," was his verdict, "and
ought to have been in bed three or four days
ago. Find a house to put him in and a
woman to nurse him."</p>

<p>Bill had one of the softest and sweetest
voices I ever heard. He came to me and
laid his cool hand on my forehead. "Don't
you worry about those men, Father," he said
gently. "I'll attend to that. Now who do
you want to nurse you?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Perrigo," I replied. "She has just
built a new cabin. I helped her with it.
Her husband is recovering from the fever."</p>

<p>Soon the good woman was in my tent,
eager to serve. I was carried through a
driving snow-storm to her cabin. It was a
rude affair built of rough boards set upright
and battened with narrow, half-inch strips.
A single thickness of building-paper poorly
supplemented the inch boards. But cold
and uncomfortable as it was, it was the only
available shelter. I had them bring my tent
and make a storm-shed of it in front of the
door. There, for more than two months, I
was to lie helpless.</p>

<p>My friends told me afterwards of the
consternation that my illness caused. I was
chairman of all the general relief committees&mdash;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the town council, the citizens,
the mission, the Odd Fellows. That
the leader should thus be laid aside seemed a
greater calamity than was actually the case.
For Mr. Wirt of the Congregational Church
arrived with lumber to erect a hospital, and
Raymond Robins, a young man of great
earnestness and talent, who has since arisen
to national prominence, came with him to
help in Christian work.</p>

<p>The night after I was taken to the Perrigo
cabin, there was a meeting of the Odd Fellows'
Club. Billy Murtagh was present and
made his first public speech. As my illness
and the general situation was discussed he
rose to his feet, the tears streaming down
his face. He seemed unconscious of them&mdash;or,
at least, unashamed.</p>

<p>"Fellers," he faltered, "I'm hard hit.
This gets me where I live. Now I'll tell you
this: you fellers can look after the other sick
folks, and call on me when you need any
money. But I want you to leave Father
Young to me. I've adopted him. He's my
father. All I've got is his. If there's anything
in this camp he needs, he's goin' to
have it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, that long, desperate fight for life!
The stunning pain in my head, the high
fever, the delirium, the nervous terror, the
deadly weakness, the emaciation, the chills
and nausea! I was badly handicapped in
my fight. The two months of wearing work
and strain which preceded my illness had
exhausted me, body and mind&mdash;there was
no vital reserve to draw upon.</p>

<p>I was in a little, cold shanty, twelve feet
square, crowded and unhealthy. Two people
besides myself must live in that tiny
room&mdash;sleep there, cook there. The savage
arctic winter raged against us, howling his
vengeance upon our impudence in thus
braving him, unprepared. He made every
nail-head inside the house a knob of frost.
When my blankets, damp with the steam of
cooking, touched the wall, he clamped them
so tight one must tear the fabric in pulling
it free. He made my clothing, stowed under
the cot, a solid lump of ice. He asphyxiated
us with foul gases when the door was
closed, and filled the room instantly with
fine snow from the condensation of the
moisture when it was opened. He charged
constantly upon the thin shell of the house
with his high October and November winds,
shaking it wildly and threatening to bowl it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
over. He drove, in horizontal sheets, the
fine, flour-like snow, shooting it through
batten-crevice, door-crack and keyhole;
and, finding myriad small apertures in the
shake roof, sifted it down upon my face.
He piled it in fantastic whirls around the
house, selecting the side on which our one
small window was, to bank it highest, so that
he might shut out our light. He sent the
red spirit in the thermometer tube down,
down, down&mdash;ten below zero, twenty, thirty
when it stormed, and forty, fifty, sixty below
when it was still, and the black death-mist
brooded over the icy wastes and men
breathed ice-splinters instead of air.</p>

<p>The fuel supply for the Nome camp was
very poor and scanty. Men were digging
old, sodden logs of driftwood out of the
snow, and hauling this sorry fire-wood
twenty miles by hand. Coal was scarce and
sold by the ton for $150.00, or by the bucket
for ten cents a pound.</p>

<p>Having had experience with typhoid
epidemics and other sicknesses in the Klondike
Stampede, I had laid in a good supply
of nice foods for the sick, such as malted
milk, the best brands of condensed milk,
tapioca, farina, and other delicacies; but all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of these had been given away before my own
illness, and there was a scarcity of such
articles in the stores.</p>

<p>But my friends, women and men,&mdash;indeed,
everybody in the camp seemed interested
in me and anxious to do something for me&mdash;arose
to meet all these emergencies and
"ministered to mine infirmities." The Odd
Fellows supplemented the efforts of the
convalescent, but still shaky Perrigo, and cut
the wind-packed snow into bricks and built
it around the house, until it looked like a
veritable Eskimo igloo. It was much
warmer after this was done.</p>

<p>The doctors at Nome all prescribed a diet
of milk and whiskey for their fever patients.
Upon the news of my illness circulating in
the camp a dozen bottles of different brands
were at once sent to me. Billy came, examined,
smelled at, and tasted these liquors,
with the air of an expert. Then he bundled
all the bottles into a gunny sack and carried
them away, saying, "He's not going to have
any of this dope. I've got some of the pure
stuff, made in Ireland." And he brought
me an ample supply for all my needs, and a
gallon of pure alcohol for sponge-baths.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The Odd Fellows organized wood-cutting
"bees" for my benefit, and daily carried
water from the well for Mrs. Perrigo's use.
The women collected food and milk from
their own stores and those of others, and
brought them to me. The fellowship of
the wilderness, the finest in the world, had
its full exercise for my benefit there at
Nome. I doubt if there was a person in all
that great camp who would not have given
me cheerfully his last can of milk.</p>

<p>As the fever progressed and my condition
grew more serious, the daily visitors
were restricted to two&mdash;Mrs. Strong and
Bunch-grass Bill. The lady looked after
matters of business, my letters, and information
about other sick people. Billy, with
his soft, low voice and gentle manner,
hovered over me, sitting for hours at my
bedside, lifting me in his two big hands with
infinite care and deftness. Never did son
care for father with more tender solicitude
and fuller devotion than did this Irish
Catholic saloon-keeper, this "bad man" of
the western frontier, for me&mdash;a Protestant
preacher.</p>

<p>There were many malamute dogs at
Nome, great, beautiful, wolf-like beasts, and
the "malamute chorus" was much in evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in the late hours of the night. One,
in particular, which was tied up not far from
Perrigo's cabin, tuned up regularly every
morning at three o'clock with his high-pitched
tremolo, waking every dog within
a mile, until all were howling, and keeping
it up till daylight. There was no sleep possible
for me while this concert was in progress,
and I used to lie awake for hours, waiting
fearfully for the leader to begin, and to
cower in my robes with nervous chills
coursing down my spine at every renewal
of the long-drawn cadence, "Oo-o-o-o-o,
oo-o-o-o-o, ow, ow, ow, ow."</p>

<p>My fever would always rise with the
commencement of this discordant chorus and
increase as long as it continued, and the
doctor on his morning visit would find me
exhausted and trembling. The words of
Clarence would chase each other through
my brain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trembling wak'd, and, for a season after<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could not believe but what I was in hell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Perrigo told Billy of the nuisance.
He stayed up that night until the leading
canine musician shrieked his solo to the
moon. He followed up the sound until he
found the dog, roused the grumbling owner,
paid the high price asked for the animal, led
him down the beach half a mile, and shot
him.</p>

<p>An errand of an opposite character also
fell to Billy's lot. The barracks which
housed a squadron of United States soldiers
was less than a block from the cabin in
which I lay. Every night at eleven o'clock
a bugle of remarkable sweetness and
expression would blow "<a href="#Page_56">Taps.</a>" I would
listen for the soothing melody, and when it
would sound I would turn over in my robe
and obey its command, "Go-o-o to sle-e-ep."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Craig, the commander of the
post, ordered the discontinuance of "Taps,"
thinking it would disturb me and the other
sick people. That night I waited, as usual,
for the "good-night" bugle, and when it did
not sound I grew anxious and distraught.
I thought my watch was wrong or the bugler
must be sick. I grew excited, restless and
feverish, and passed a sleepless night, missing
my accustomed lullaby. We told Billy;

forth on the still night air, and I slept.</p>

</div>

<p>Another cause of nervousness and anxiety
arose, requiring the efforts of both Mrs.
Strong and Billy Murtagh to solve the difficulty.
I was paying my nurse, Mrs. Perrigo,
five dollars a day, which was almost
all she and her husband had to live on.
They had been eating for a year and a half
a food outfit designed for only a single
season, and there was but little of it left.
Mr. Perrigo, who was a Yankee tintype-picture
peddler and knew no other trade,
had tried his best to be a gold-miner; but,
in common with the rest of the forlorn
"Kobuckers," had made nothing at all.
His wife, who had been a bookkeeper in
Boston, valiantly took up the trades of waitress,
washerwoman and cook in the Arctic
wilderness, but there was but little money in
that disappointed crowd. Almost immediately
after landing on the "golden sands"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of Nome in August Mr. Perrigo was stricken
with the fever. With the fearful prices that
prevailed, my five dollars a day was little
enough to feed them and meet the monthly
payments on their house.</p>

<p>I had accumulated $125.00&mdash;mostly wedding
fees&mdash;when I was taken sick. It
melted away like a spoonful of sugar in a
cup of hot coffee. Every Monday I must
have thirty-five dollars for my faithful nurse.
I placed in Mrs. Strong's hands for sale my
Parker shotgun, my typewriter, my gold-scales,
my extra overcoat, all gifts from
friends. She got good prices for them, and
for the few articles I could spare from my
food supply&mdash;but still the phantom weekly
payment menaced me. When I closed my
eyes the figures&mdash;$35.00&mdash;big and lurid&mdash;stared
at me, and in my delirious dreams became
red goblins, mocking me.</p>

<p>A splendid woman, member of the church
which assumed my salary, had given me two
beautiful wolf robes. I was lying in the
heavier one. I delivered the other to Mrs.
Strong. "Sell it for me," I requested.
"You ought to get fifty or sixty dollars
for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>A week passed&mdash;then another. Mrs.
Strong reported she "was holding the robe
for a higher price." The crisis I had dreaded
had arrived. My money was gone. I
had none to meet next Monday's payment.</p>

<p>"Sell the robe for what it will bring," I
directed Mrs. Strong. "I must have the
money."</p>

<p>"I'll sell it on Saturday," she promised.</p>

<p>Monday morning Mrs. Strong marched in
with a large canvas money-bag in her hand.
With Mrs. Perrigo's assistance she counted
out the money, which was mostly in silver
coins. Then she wrote in large figures,
"$158.50," and pinned the paper on the wall
by my head.</p>

<p>"Where on earth did you get that
money?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Why, for the robe, of course."</p>

<p>"You never got all that for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," she affirmed.</p>

<p>Then the truth dawned upon me. "Mrs.
Strong!" I exclaimed, "you raffled the
robe!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she laughed. "What are you going
to do about it?"</p>

<p>Then she explained. Finding it impossible
to get a fair price for the fur blanket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
she and Bunch-grass Bill had laid their
heads together. They knew that I would
not consent to a raffle, so they kept the
matter quiet. Bill displayed the robe in
front of his saloon. Shares were offered at
fifty cents each. My lady friends of the
mission sold tickets. Bill bought fifty and
others of my friends did almost as well.
Their purpose if they won the robe was to
give it back to me.</p>

<p>What could I do? To rebuke their kindly
deception would be ungracious indeed.
With brimming eyes I thanked my friends,
and Mrs. Perrigo got her money.</p>

<p>But the greatest of Bunch-grass Bill's
many acts of kindness towards me remains
to be told. As Dr. Davy had said from the
first, mine was "a bad case." I had seven
and a half weeks of high fever before it
broke, whereas the usual limit of fever was
three weeks. I reached the extreme of
emaciation and weakness. I could hardly
lift my hand. When they bundled me in a
blanket like a baby and hung me on the hook
of a big steelyard I weighed sixty pounds!
I was long in the Valley of the Shadow of
Death and reached its utmost boundary,
until the very waters of the dark river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lapped my feet.</p>

<p>"Well, Bill," said Dr. Davy with a sigh,
as he was returning one morning from his
call upon me, and stopped, as was his custom,
to report to the "Beach Saloon," "I'm
afraid it's about over. I don't think Dr.
Young can last much longer. He can retain
nothing on his stomach. We've tried all the
brands of condensed milk in the camp to no
avail. Everything comes up the instant it
is swallowed. There are many internal
complications, and he may go off any hour in
one of those deathly convulsive chills."</p>

<p>"Big Wilbur," who reported the scene
to me afterwards, said that Bill's face "went
white as chalk, and then flushed red as fire."
He jumped at the doctor as though he were
going to assault him.</p>

<p>"By God," he cried, "he's not goin' to
die. We'll not let him, Doc. See here:
When I had the fever at Dawson, what
saved me was cow's milk. Now, there's a
cow here. You come with me, and we'll go
see her."</p>

<p>"That cow," explained Wilbur, "was a
wonderful animal. Her owner sold twenty
gallons of milk a day from her, and she
didn't look as if she gave one. Bill knew the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
owner was doping the milk with condensed
milk and corn-starch and water and other
stuff. So he strapped on his two big guns.
He's great for bluff, is Bill. Doc. and I
went along to see the fun. We found the
owner in the stable 'tending to his cow.
Bill didn't beat around the bush any.</p>

<p>"'You look here' he said. 'Your cow's
givin' too darned much milk. Now this
man I want it for is my father, an' he's got
enough microbes in him already. Doc. here,
analyzed your milk; didn't you, Doc?' (Doc.
Davy was game, and nodded.) 'He says
you put tundra water and all kinds of dope
in it. I'm goin' to keep tab on you, an' if
you dope my milk&mdash;well, you know <em>me</em>! It
don't make no difference what you charge&mdash;a
dollar a bottle or five dollars a bottle&mdash;my
father's got to have pure milk. Understand?'"</p>

<p>For three months Billy went to the stable
every day and superintended the milking.
At a cost to him, sometimes, of three dollars
for a pint bottle, and never less than a
dollar a bottle, the "bad man" brought me
every day, with his own hands, a bottle of
fresh milk. When Bill and the doctor
came in with that first bottle Mrs. Perrigo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
carefully raised my head and gave me a
brimming glass of the rich milk. I drank it
all and dropped off to sleep. I needed no
more whiskey. The turning point of my
illness was that glass of cow's milk. Bill's
big bluff saved my life!</p>

<p>To show the rough, yet fine sentiment of
the man, let me tell one last word about the
lone cow. She went dry before spring, and,
as the camp was crazy for fresh meat, the
owner butchered her. One of the Odd Fellows
told me. Said he, "Bill just went wild
when he heard of it, and we had all we could
do to keep him from going gunning for the
man who killed the cow that saved your life.
Why, that man would lay down his life for
you, and laugh while he was doin' it."</p>

<p>I would I could tell of Bunch-grass Bill's
conversion and entire reformation, but this
is a true story, and I never heard that he
ever got so far as that. This much, however,
I am proud to tell. One day in the
spring of 1900, when the army of gold-seekers
was beginning to land on the
"Golden Beach," I was standing with Bill
near his saloon. On a sudden impulse I
spoke to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Billy," I said, "I love you, but I don't
like your business. It's a bad business.
See what it has done to lots of good fellows
around here. You are too big for that
game. I wish you'd drop it and do something
that's clean&mdash;that doesn't hurt anybody."</p>

<p>Bill made no reply, and I supposed my
words had been fruitless. But in a few weeks
one of my friends informed me that Bill had
sold out and had gone to gold-mining.</p>

<p>"That's good!" I exclaimed. "Did he
give any reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the man replied, "Bill said you
told him to."</p>

<p>When I was returning to Alaska in 1901,
I bought a nice buffalo smoking-set at the
Pan-American Exposition and took it to
Alaska for Bunch-grass Bill. I did not see
him, as he was mining at a distance, but I
heard of his pride and pleasure as he displayed
the gift and talked affectionately of
"Father Young." He left Alaska that
summer, and I have heard vaguely of his
presence in the Nevada gold-fields. But
wherever he is, I pray that God may bless
and save the Irish saloon-keeper, who loved
me and saved my life.</p>

<h2><a name="ChIV" id="ChIV">IV</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>MY DOGS</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">M</span><span class="smcap">ushing</span> with dogs in Alaska is
the worst and the best mode of
traveling in all the world&mdash;the
most joyful and the most exasperating&mdash;according
to the angle from which you look
at it.</p>

<p>Once I was preaching a series of sermons
on the Ten Commandments to the miners
at Council, a town on Seward Peninsula
eighty-five miles east of Nome. I had come
to the Third Commandment; and I bore
down pretty hard upon the useless and foolish
habit of profane swearing.</p>

<p>When I was going home from the meeting,
a group of young men stood on the
corner waiting for me.</p>

<p>"Come over here, Doctor," called one of
the men. "I have a bet with Jim, and I
want you to decide it."</p>

<p>I crossed over to the jolly group. "What
is your bet?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," he replied, "I've bet Jim five
dollars that you have never mushed a dog-team."</p>

<p>"Well, you've lost," I answered. "I have
driven dogs many times&mdash;and never found it
necessary to swear at them, either."</p>

<p>Before I go on with my story, perhaps I
would better explain that word "mush," as
it is used in the Northwest. The word is
never used in Alaska as you use it in the
East, to denote porridge, or some sort of
cereal. There we say "oatmeal" or "corn-meal,"
or simply "cereal."</p>

<p>In Alaska the word has but one use. It is
a corruption of the French <em>marchez, marche</em>,
which the Canadian <em>coureurs du bois</em>, or
travelers of the woods, shout at their dogs
when urging them along the trail. From
<em>marche</em> to "mush" is easy. So now,
throughout the great Northwest, Canadian
or Alaskan, when a man is traveling he is
"on a mush." When he is speaking to his
dogs, either to drive them out of the house
or to urge them along the trail, he shouts
"mush!" If he be a good traveler, he is a
"great musher." Of all the pet names they
used to give me up there, the one of which
I was proudest was "The Mushing Parson."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>They tell a story, which has the ear-marks
of truth, which illustrates this universal use
of the word "mush" in the Northwest.</p>

<p>Two miners, who for years had been in
the mining camps of Alaska, at last came
"outside" to Seattle. In the morning they
went to a restaurant for breakfast and took
seats at a table. A rather cross-looking
waitress came to take their order. "Mush?"
she asked. The miners looked at one another
in surprise and alarm. The woman
waited a while, and when they did not answer
she supposed they were deaf and had
not heard her question. "Mush?" she
screamed. The two men arose and fled.
When they got safely to the sidewalk, one
said to the other, "Now, what the Sam
Hill did she fire us for?"</p>

<p>There are three principal breeds of native
dogs found in Alaska&mdash;the Husky, the
Malamute and the Siberian Dog&mdash;all
descendants of wolves, with wolfish traits
and the wolf's warm coat and powers of
endurance. Of these the Malamute is the
largest, descended, as he is, from the great
gray wolves of the Arctic regions. The
Husky seems to be derived from the red
wolf of the McKenzie River Valley;
while the Siberian Dog has for ancestor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the smaller, shorter-legged, heavier-furred
Arctic wolf of the Siberian coast. The
smaller and more worthless dogs of the
southern Alaska Coast, if descended from
wolves, must have the coyote as their
progenitor&mdash;having his lighter and slimmer
body and his sneaking, thievish, cowardly
disposition.</p>

<p>Everywhere, however, the dog is largely
what his master makes him, and these
northern wolf-dogs have greatly improved
since they have fallen into the hands of
white masters. More intelligent breeding,
greater care in feeding and more careful
training, have made them what they are&mdash;the
finest, most enduring and most dependable
sleigh-dogs in the world.</p>

<p>The dog is by all odds the most valuable
animal of the Northwest to the white miner
and settler. He is the miner's horse,
bicycle, automobile, locomotive, all in one.
Life in those wilds would be almost
unendurable without him. The miners appreciate
this, and cases of cruelty and mistreatment
are very rare. In the days of the
early gold stampedes the <em>cheechackos</em> or
tenderfeet, who knew but little about life in
the wilderness, and still less about the dogs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
of the wilderness, sometimes were guilty of
abusing their dogs; but this very seldom
occurred, and the old-timers always frowned
upon, and sometimes punished, cases of
cruelty. I remember once holding, with
joy, the coat of one of these old-timers at
Dawson in the strenuous winter of 1897-8,
while he administered a very beautiful and
artistic thrashing to a newcomer who was
guilty of beating his dogs with a heavy chain
and knocking out the eye of one of them.</p>

<p>But I cannot better give you an idea of
what dog-mushing in the Northwest is than
by sketching a trip I took to a meeting of
the Presbytery of Yukon in March, 1912.
I was at Iditarod, a new gold-mining town
in the western interior of Alaska. The
meeting was to be held at Cordova on the
southern coast, seven hundred and twenty
miles distant. To reach Cordova I must
cross four mountain ranges&mdash;the Western,
the Alaska, the Chugach and the Kenai
Ranges; and traverse four great river
valleys&mdash;the Yukon, the Kuskoquim, the
Susitna and the Matanuska. There was
first a very rough stretch of rudely marked
trail five hundred and twenty miles to
Seward. There I would take a steamboat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
two hundred miles to Cordova. Let us betake
ourselves together to this big miner's
camp, and talk the matter over in the free,
familiar way of the Northwest:</p>

<p>A young fellow of Scotch descent hailing
from the north of Ireland, William Breeze,
known far and wide as an experienced "dog
musher," is to be my companion on this
trip. He is bound for Susitna, three hundred
miles from Iditarod, on a prospecting
trip, and will take care of my dogs, boil their
feed at night and do the heaviest part of
the work.</p>

<a name="dog" id="dog"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image7.jpg" width="600" height="362" alt="Dr. Young and his Dog Team" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">Dr. Young and his Dog Team</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">Iditarod, February, 1912</p>

<p>And now let me introduce you to my
team. It is one of the finest teams in all
the North. There are five pups of the same
litter, now six or seven years old. They are
a cross between the McKenzie River husky
and the shepherd dog, and have the long
hair and hardy endurance of the former and
the sagacity, intelligence and affection of
the latter. Being brothers, they know each
other and are taught to work together,
although this fact does not hinder them from
engaging in a general free-for-all fight now
and again. However, if attacked by strange
dogs the whole five work together beautifully,
centering their forces with Napoleonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
strategy and beating the enemy in detail.</p>

<p>The leader is black, white and tan, marked
like a shepherd dog. He has been named
"Nigger," but I have changed his name
simply to "Leader." It sounds enough like
the original to please him and keep him going.
He is a splendid leader. He has a
swift, swinging pace, and can keep the trail
when it is covered a foot deep by fresh snow
and there is no external sign of it. He has
that intelligence which leads him to avoid
dangers, and he will stop and look back at
you if there is a hole in the ice or a dangerous
slide, awaiting your orders and co-operation
before he essays the difficult
problem. His knowledge of "Gee" and
"Haw" is perfect, the tone in which you
pronounce these words and the force with
which you utter them telling him just how
far to the right, or to the left, he is to swing.
"<em>Gee!</em>" spoken in a short, explosive, loud
tone will turn him square to the right, while
"Ge-e-e, ge-e-e-e," in soft lengthened
syllables, will make him veer slowly and
gradually. His sense of responsibility is
very great, and his censorship of the conduct
of his fellow teamsters very severe. He will
not tolerate any shirking on their part and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
takes keen delight in their correction when
they deserve it. But he will fly at your
throat if you touch <em>him</em> with the whip.</p>

<p>The "swing dogs" just behind him are
"Moose" and "Ring," colored like Irish
setters. They have exactly the same gait,
are the same size, and almost the same
coloring, "Ring" a little lighter than
"Moose" and with a white collar around
his neck which suggested his name.
"Moose" is a little gentleman, the loveliest
dog I have ever known. His traces are always
taut, and when you utter his name he
will jump right up into the air, straining on
his collar. He knows the words of command
as well as the leader, and has never,
perhaps, been touched with the whip. I
think chastisement would break his heart,
for he would know it was unmerited. He is
my pet, the one dog of the team that I allow
in my cabin, and my companion in my short
journeys through the camp. He is remarkably
clean and dainty in his habits, his coat
shining like polished bronze. He would
guard my person or my coat with his life, the
most faithful, intelligent and affectionate
dog I have ever had. I love that dog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ring" is also willing, but has not the
intelligence or the good nature of "Moose."
He is a scrapper and apt to embroil the rest
of the team in a general fight. But he will
work all day at his highest tension.</p>

<p>"Teddy" and "Sheep," the "wheel
dogs," are not so valuable as the other three.
"Teddy" has the longest hair and the lightest
weight of any, and the least strength;
but he is a willing little fellow and a very
keen hunter. Make a noise like a squirrel
or a bird, and he will prick up his ears and
dash down the path after the game, and
when a real rabbit or ptarmigan crosses his
path he will tear madly along until the game
is passed. You can fool him every minute
of the day, and Breeze has a way of imitating
the little birds that keeps "Teddy"
working his hardest.</p>

<p>"Sheep" is a malingerer. He is a clown,
and so comical that you cannot help laughing
at him, even when you know he deserves
a good thrashing. He is fat, heavy
and awkward. In color he is a light, tawny
yellow, with long hair like "Teddy," but
labors under the serious disability of having
a different gait from the others. They are
pacers; he is a trotter. When they are
swinging rhythmically along at a five-mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
gait, "Sheep" has to lope, his trot not being
equal to the occasion. He has a way
of playing off sick or fagged; but if game
appears, he forgets all about his pretenses,
his lameness is all gone in a second and he
is the keenest of the team. Also, when
nearing the camp he forgets his weariness
and pulls harder than any of the team. It
is necessary to let him see the whip
constantly, and occasionally to feel it, and
he is the only one of the team that
necessitates its use at all.</p>

<p>About once a day, on the trail, a funny
scene has to be enacted. We may be laboring
up a long hill, or wallowing through
deep snow, the difficult ascent requiring
every man and dog to do his best. "Sheep"
will get tired, and, with a backward look at
me to see if I am noticing, will let his traces
slacken. I give him a touch of the whip,
and, although he can hardly feel the lash
through his thick coat, he yelps and pulls
manfully for a short distance; but presently
his trace chain sags again. Soon "Leader"
notices the heavier pulling and, knowing
where the blame lies, turns his head, shows
his teeth and growls at "Sheep," who jumps
into his collar and pulls like a good fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Soon he forgets and lets up again, getting a
fiercer growl from "Leader." A third time
he is a slacker. Then "Leader" stops and
begins to swing around carefully so as not
to tangle the harness. "Moose" and
"Ring" and "Teddy" all stand still and
look at "Sheep." That unfortunate trotter
lies down on his back with his feet in the
air and begins to howl in anguish. I sit
down on the sled and wait&mdash;I know what is
coming. "Leader" reaches "Sheep" and
for about a minute there is a bedlam of
savage growls from "Leader" and piercing
shrieks from "Sheep." I notice that
"Leader" does not take the culprit by the
throat, but only pinches the loose hide on
his breast and side. That cannot injure him,
so I am not uneasy. The punishment over,
"Leader" resumes his place. "Sheep"
gets up and shakes himself with an air of
relief. I take the handle-bars and call
"Mush." For the rest of the day "Sheep"
pulls for all he is worth; but the next day he
forgets and has to be trounced again.</p>

<p>I am conscious that this story may have a
"fishy" flavor for some of my readers, but
I can assure them it is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>But mine are all fine little dogs, not as
large as the malamute, but with more courage,
spirit and intelligence. The long hair
protects them from the cold and they will
cuddle down in the snow contentedly, curled
up like little shrimps, and let it cover them.</p>

<p>We must take along enough feed for the
dogs, to last them from salmon stream to
salmon stream. The staple of their feed is
dried salmon; it goes a long way for its
weight. We start with a hundred pounds
of it, and fifty pounds of rice and tallow.
This, boiled into a savory mess and served
once a day (when they stop for the night),
keeps the dogs fat and hearty. We shall
replenish the supply at intervals, for five
dogs will eat an immense amount of food,
and must have all that they can eat at their
daily meal.</p>

<p>The sled is a basket-sleigh with handle-bars
and brake at the back and a "gee-pole"
in front, with an extra rope when we have
to "neck it" to help the dogs. My wolf-robe
is spread on the floor of the sleigh for
my accommodation in the brief intervals of
riding. For dog mushing in Alaska does
not mean luxuriously riding in your sleigh
wrapped up in your fur robe while the dogs
haul you along the trail. When Dr. Egbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Koonce sledded twelve hundred miles from
Rampart to Valdez in 1902 on his way to the
General Assembly, I told the Assembly of
the feat. A good friend from Philadelphia
said: "It must after all be a really luxurious
way of traveling, wrapped up in your furs
and reclining in a comfortable sleigh behind
your dogs." I turned to Koonce and asked
him how much of that twelve hundred miles
he rode. "About two miles," he replied.</p>

<p>I shall ride more than this on my way to
Seward, but there will not be many places
where I can ride half a mile at a stretch
without getting out and running behind the
dogs. The beauty of "dog mushing" is
that you are compelled to work as hard as
the dogs. You are not on a well-beaten
boulevard; you are wending your way
around trees and stumps, over hummocks,
up and down hills, along the sides of the
mountains, and must keep your hands on
the handle-bars, lifting the sled on the trail
when it runs off and often breaking the trail
ahead with your snow-shoes. When the
dogs are on fairly good roads they swing
along uninterruptedly and you run your best
behind. If there are two of you, one holds
the handle-bars and the other sprints along,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
either in front or behind the sleigh. You
will get pretty tired the first two or three
days, but after your muscles become hardened
and you get your second wind, you can
run at your keenest gait two or three miles
at a time.</p>

<p>But let us get started. All preparations
are made, the supply of dog-feed loaded, our
robes and blankets put aboard, heavy canvas
corded around the load and our snow-shoes
strapped on top. We shall not need a gun,
for there will be plenty of game to be had
at the roadhouses, and we shall not have
time to bother with hunting. We have a
long journey to make and everything must
bend to getting over the ground. That
"ribbon of the trail" must be unwound for
five hundred and twenty miles. A company
of warm and sympathetic friends foregather
to bid us "good-bye," and off we go.</p>

<p>The trail is well beaten from Iditarod to
Flat City, seven and a half miles, and I get
aboard, with Breeze at the handle-bars. My
huskies leap into the harness at the word of
command and we make a flying start. They
are just as keen to go as we are, and seem
to enjoy it as well. I ride perhaps half a
mile then jump off without stopping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
team, and run ahead of the dogs up the long
hill. I soon find my fur parka too heavy,
and discard it for the lighter one made of
drilling, in which I do the rest of my mushing
to the end of the trail. Moccasins are
on my feet, for the trail must be taken
flat-footed if one is to have reasonable
comfort.</p>

<p>After two or three miles we leave the
broad road and strike the trail through the
wilderness. Our sled is twenty-one inches
wide, light and shod with steel, and the
trail, henceforth, will be about twenty-four
inches in width, sometimes sunken deep,
where snow has not recently fallen and the
trail has been well beaten, sometimes only a
trace along the snow where the wind has
blown it clean and where the trail is hard.</p>

<p>We soon begin to labor up the first divide.
No more riding now. The trail is hard
enough to dispense with snow-shoes, but
heavy enough to make us both walk and
labor. I strike the trail ahead, leaving
Breeze to the handle-bars. I begin to feel
the joy of it. The keen, light, dry air is
like wine. The trail winds through the
woods, along the edges of gorges, then up
a steep mountain. Now the timber ceases
and we have rounded, wind-swept summits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
I leave the dogs far behind, for it is heavy
pulling up the steep. Their bells tinkle
faintly from below. I gain nearly a mile on
them before they round the summit. I
strike my lope down the farther side, but
soon hear the bells as they charge down
upon me and pass me, swinging on towards
the roadhouse.</p>

<p>We only make twenty miles the first day,
for it was nearly noon when we started, and
we are glad to stop at "Bonanza Roadhouse"
as dusk is coming on. How good
the moose meat tastes! How sweet the
beds of hard boards and blankets! The
luxury of rest we enjoy to the full. The
dogs are fed, our moccasins and socks hung
up to dry, and we crawl in our bunks with
sighs of relief. There is no floor in the
roadhouse; all the lumber has been whipsawed
by hand, the furniture manufactured
out of boxes and stumps, the utensils of the
rudest. But the luxury of splendid meat
and good sour-dough bread and coffee
makes us feel that we have all that goes to
make life desirable.</p>

<p>An early morning start is necessary. We
eat our breakfast by candle-light, fill up our
thermos bottle with hot coffee, take a big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
hunk of roasted meat for lunch, and "hit
the trail" by daylight. Twenty-six miles
to-day&mdash;to "Moorecreek Roadhouse." Snow
begins to fall, and soon the trail is
obliterated by the fast-coming feathery flakes.
Now the snow-shoes must be unstrapped and one
of us break the trail ahead. We take turns
and swing along at a three and a half mile
gait. This is real work, and we reach the
roadhouse in the middle of the afternoon,
but not so tired as on the preceding day.</p>

<p>These are samples of the journey throughout;
but oh, the variety!&mdash;no two miles
alike&mdash;and the panorama of beauty that unfolds
before us!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Each fir tree flings a bridal veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A bridal veil of shimmering white,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like stately maidens tall and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Slow marching as to solemn rite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the ribbon of the trail."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Notice the beauty of the frost sparkling
on the trees. The wonderful law that gives
its own distinct varieties of frost crystals to
each species of tree, fir, spruce, birch, cottonwood
or alder, is exemplified so plainly here
that, after the first examination, you can
tell the kind of tree under the frost crystals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by the shade of silver. The mountains
tower above you, wind-swept, waving snow-banners.
The vastness of that white hush
awes and thrills you. A rough sound would
be blasphemy in the solemn silence. The
whole landscape is a poem.</p>

<p>To relate even the leading incidents of
this "joy-mush" of three weeks would take
up too much space. The longest distance
we traveled in any one day was fifty-five
miles; while our hardest and longest day's
struggle through drifted snow and over a
steep mountain pass yielded us only twelve
miles of trail. In most of the roadhouses I
found old friends, and, in several of them,
Christian people who had been members of
missions I had established in new mining
camps. What grand times we had together!
No fellowship is so warm and sweet as that
of the wilderness. Of many adventures on
the trail I can give but two.</p>

<p>One morning, about half-way from Iditarod
to Seward, we left the fine cabin of
French Joe, on the South Fork of the Kuskoquim
River, under the two beautiful
peaks, Mts. Egypt and Pyramid. We were
making for Rainy Pass over the Alaskan
Range. What follows is an extract from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
an account I wrote at the time.</p>

<p>The day out from Joe's I meet with my
first disaster. We have nineteen miles of
absolutely clear ice on the South Fork of
the Kuskoquim. The river is full of
air-holes and open riffles. The dogs swing
along at a ripping pace, digging their toe
nails into the hard ice, the sled slipping
sideways and sliding dangerously near to the
open places. Breeze often has to run ahead
at full speed to choose a route, for there is
no trail on the ice. Half-way up the river
I "get gay," as Breeze calls it. I leave the
handle-bars to find a route, and fall down
hard on the smooth ice. A sharp pang
strikes through the small of my back as if
from a spear-thrust. I get up and go along,
thinking the pain will cease, but soon I
realize that I am in the grip of an old enemy,
lumbago.</p>

<p>From this point on to Seward I cannot
make a move without pain, sometimes so
great that I gasp for breath. At night in
the roadhouse I have great trouble in getting
into my bunk, and sometimes Breeze has
to lift me out in the morning. Were I at
home I would be in bed for a couple of
weeks with doctors and nurses fussing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
me, but it is just as well that I cannot stop.
I take the philosophy of an old fellow in the
"Rainy Pass Roadhouse" near the summit
of the range, who says the best cure for a
lame back is to "keep on a-mushin'"!</p>

<p>Beyond Rainy Pass we drop into the
canyon of Happy River, and here we have
our famous moose-hunt. Soon after we
enter the gorge we come upon its tracks&mdash;a
big bull-moose. We have already traveled
nearly thirty miles to-day, and are anxious
to make the roadhouse twelve or fifteen
miles further on; and now, here comes this
big, blundering beast to poke our trail full
of deep holes and excite our dogs. He is
running ahead of us. The snow is five or
six feet deep and he goes in almost to his
back at every step. The walls of the canyon
are sheer and he cannot escape up its side.
The river turns and winds, and here and
there are little patches of level ground, thick
with large spruce trees.</p>

<p>For three miles we do not catch sight of
the moose, but our dogs show that he is on
ahead. In spite of my lame back I have to
struggle on in front of them and bat
"Leader" in the face with my cap, Breeze
standing on the brake to keep them from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
running away. The moose tracks fill our
trail for a while, smashing it all to pieces,
then veer sideways to a little patch of
woods, and the dogs go pell-mell in the
moose track, burying our sled out of sight
in the deep snow. Then we have to haul
them around and lift the sled on the track
again, and try to get them along the trail.</p>

<p>Three miles down the river we catch sight
of the big moose, and the dogs go wild.
"Sheep," who has been disposed to malinger,
is the worst of the lot. He forgets all his
maladies and weariness and dashes forward,
but "Leader" will not leave the track and
swings along as best he can, except when
the moose is in full sight. Then I have
to bat him in the face to keep the team in
bounds. Our bells are tingling, our dogs
barking and we are shouting. It is a fearsome
thing to the bull-moose, this animated
machine that is charging down the river at
him. So on he struggles through the deep
snow, spoiling our trail and filling my
companion's mind with blasphemous thoughts
which occasionally break out in expression,
in spite of his respect for my "cloth."</p>

<p>Four miles of this moose-hunt, with the
big brute growing more tired and we more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
anxious to pass him. Instead of our hunting
the moose he is haunting us. At last,
around a little point of woods, we see him
lying down in the middle of the river right
ahead of us. The dogs break bounds and
almost upset me as they dash down the
trail with Breeze standing on the brake and
yelling "Whoa!" The weary bull-moose
staggers to his feet again and makes the edge
of the woods, but there lies down again.</p>

<p>The trail veers right up to him. I run
ahead and take "Leader" and "Ring," one
in each hand, and Breeze does the same
with "Teddy" and "Sheep." "Moose"
is more tractable and we can control him
with our voices. We drag the dogs bodily
with the sled behind, pass the big brute, his
long face not a rod from us, and then,
setting "Leader" on the trail again, we urge
them down five miles further to "Happy
River Roadhouse." That was <em>one</em> hunt in
which I was glad to lose the game.</p>

<p>Four hundred miles from our starting
point we put up at the "Pioneer Roadhouse"
in the little town of Knik at the head
of Cook's Inlet. This was one of half a
dozen small towns around Knik Arm and
Turn-again Arm, the two prongs of Cook's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Inlet. These towns had been in existence
for fifteen or twenty years, with gold-miners
and their families living there; and yet, here
at Knik, I preached the first sermon that had
ever been preached in a region larger than
the state of Pennsylvania! This visit led
to the establishment of a number of missions
in that region, which is now traversed by
the new Government railroad. The towns
of Anchorage and Matanuska have sprung
into existence and a thriving population of
railroad builders, coal miners, gold miners,
farmers and men of other trades and professions
has settled there.</p>

<p>I left Iditarod on March fifth. I swung
into Seward at nine o'clock on the morning
of March twenty-eighth and was heartily
greeted and entertained by Rev. L. S. Pedersen,
pastor of the Methodist Church. He was
a photographer as well as a preacher, and
took the picture of my arrival. In spite of
their hard work, my dogs were fatter and
fuller of "pep" than when we started.</p>

<p>I fairly cried when I bade my team good-bye
at Seward, taking each beautiful head
in my arms and talking to them all. They
seemed to feel the parting as keenly as I,
for there was a general chorus of mournful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
howls as I turned away. I never saw my
splendid dogs again, for the man who engaged
to take them back to Iditarod failed to
keep to his bargain, and I had to give them
to the man who cared for and fed them at
Susitna. I shall never find another team
like them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the heaviness of the
trail, the bitter struggles over mountains
and through deep snows, not to mention the
pains of lumbago, I look back upon that trip
and other trips like it with joyful recollection
and longing to repeat the experience.
I would rather take a trip through that
beautiful wilderness, with my dogs, than
travel luxuriously around the world on
palatial steamboats. There is more fun in
dog-mushing.</p>

<h2><a name="ChV" id="ChV">V</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>LOUIE PAUL AND THE HOOTZ</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap" style="padding-right:.8em;">"O</span><span class="smcap">h</span>, 'e's bad feller, dat hootz," exclaimed
Louie Paul, our half-breed
Stickeen young man, the
blood of his French father sparkling in his
eyes and gesturing in his hands and shoulders.
"'E's devil, 'im. Dat's no swear&mdash;dat's
truf. Bad spirit got him, sure. <em>Quonsum
sallix</em> (Always mad). 'E no savvy
scare, no savvy love, no savvy die. 'E's
devil, dat's all."</p>

<p>Louie's handsome face and coal-black
eyes were alive with excitement, as he
danced about his big bundle of <em>tseek</em> (black
bear) skins, which he had just brought into
Stevens' store at Fort Wrangell, and was
unwrapping, preparatory to bartering. His
outburst of language was called out by a
question of mine. I had been noticing with
surprise that among the great numbers of
black bear skins that were being brought
into the Wrangell stores daily by the Indians,
were none of the big brown bear&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<em>hootz</em>. I knew these brown bears to be very
plentiful up the Stickeen and Iskoot Rivers
where Louie had been hunting. At this
season (it was in early May) both species
of bears, having wakened from their long
winter's sleep, were roaming the banks of
the streams restlessly day and night, making
up in their fierce activity for their six
months of torpor. Their coats were at their
best&mdash;long, silky, glistening, thick and soft.
The skins of the black bear Louie had
brought were prime. They were more than
black. Their ebony surfaces shone and
sparkled, beneath our handling, like black
diamonds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="wrangell" id="wrangell"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image8.jpg" width="600" height="368" alt="Fort Wrangell, Alaska, on Etolin Harbor" />
</a></div>

<p class="center">Fort Wrangell, Alaska, on Etolin Harbor</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">To the left may be seen the first Protestant Church in
Alaska, built by Dr. Young, 1879</p>

<p>I knew that the skins of the hootz would
be equally beautiful and twice as large as
those of the tseek. They would not be
tawny at this season, but a rich, velvety
brown, the color of the Irish setter's coat.
In my canoe trips and steamboat voyages
up the Stickeen I had seen more brown
bears than black, standing boldly out on the
bank to watch the sputtering steamboat, or
grubbing for roots and worms in the green
patches up the mountain slopes.</p>

<p>"Why don't you shoot the big bears?" I
asked Louie. "I saw four in a bunch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
other day. Don't you see any in your hunting
trips?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he confessed, "me plenty see
hootz. All time me see heem. Yestaday
me see tree&mdash;big fellers; stand up, all same
man."</p>

<p>"What's the matter, then?" I pressed
him. "Are you afraid of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you bet you boots, I scare of heem.
I no shame scare about hootz. S'pose I big
fool, I no scare; I shoot heem.&mdash;You never
see me again no mo'."</p>

<p>Louie Paul had two claims to special
distinction. First, he was a very expert and
successful bear hunter; and, second, he was
the husband of the star pupil of Mrs. McFarland's
Home for Girls,&mdash;Tilly, the handsomest
and brightest of the girls whom we
had rescued from the vileness, squalor and
sin of heathen life, and were training to be
examples and teachers of Christian civilization
to their tribe.</p>

<p>I had taken Louie and Tilly the preceding
fall and established them at Tongas, one
hundred miles south of Wrangell, outfitting
Tilly with school books, Bibles, Sunday-school
supplies, etc., and paying her a salary
as teacher to that wild tribe. Louie's task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was to keep up the fires for the school, and
to cook for his wife and supply her needs.
He had stayed at home faithfully during the
winter, procuring the venison, ducks, geese,
fish, clams, crabs, and other articles of food
they needed, and making himself useful
around the branch mission, even occasionally
leading in prayer, and exhorting the people.
But the trapper's "call of the wild" sounded
in the early spring&mdash;a call he could not resist.
So here he was, having left Tilly to
cook her own meals and make her own fires,
while he explored the streams, bayous and
lakes in his small canoe, pursuing the elusive
plantigrades.</p>

<p>The natives of Alaska at that time were
handicapped in their hunting by an order of
the Government which forbade the Indians
to own or use breech-loading guns. This
order was enforced among our peaceful
Alaska natives, who had never had a serious
trouble with the whites, while the Sioux,
Apaches and Nez Perces, who were often
on the war-path, had all the Winchester,
Henry and Enfield rifles they wanted.</p>

<p>The natives of Alaska at that time&mdash;the
early eighties&mdash;had only breech-loading,
smooth-bore Hudson Bay muskets; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
their round bullets had not much penetrating
power. They were all right for deer,
but you might fill a hootz full of those big,
round balls and he would still have strength
to tear you to pieces.</p>

<p>"The more you pester them big bear with
them old-fashioned smooth-bores," said one
of the old white hunters at Fort Wrangell,
"the madder he gits."</p>

<p>Louie Paul looked so much more like a
white man than like an Indian, and talked
English so fluently, that I had persuaded the
collector of customs&mdash;the only civil officer
we had in that region&mdash;to permit me to lend
Louie my new 45-75 Winchester repeating
rifle. The repeater was a hard-shooting,
accurate gun, chambering twelve cartridges
in the magazine&mdash;the most efficient rifle
made at that time. Louie was a fine shot,
and the possession of this rifle gave him a
great superiority over all the other Indian
bear-hunters. He made more money in his
three or four weeks of hunting in the spring
than Tilly earned by her winter's teaching.</p>

<p>"I should think you would not be afraid
of a brown bear when you have my Winchester,"
I urged. "You could put half a
dozen balls clean through him before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
could get to you."</p>

<p>Louie shook his curly head doubtfully.
"Mebby so; mebby not."</p>

<p>Then his face lit up with a broad grin.
"Mebby so I be lak Buck. You hear about
Buck an' Kokaekish?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied, scenting a story. "What
about them?"</p>

<p>I knew both these men. Kokaekish was
a fine old Indian, the father of one of our
best boys, whose Christian name was Louis
Kellogg, but whose Indian name was
Kokaek. The name, Kokaekish, means
"Kokaek's Father," illustrating the curious
custom of the Thlingets of naming parents
after their children.</p>

<p>"Buck" was a French Canadian, Alex
Choquette&mdash;a white man who had married
a Stickeen woman and had been adopted
into the tribe. He had seemingly become in
heart and life an Indian, talking the language
of his tribe, thinking their thoughts
and pursuing their customs. How thoroughly
he had become Indianized was evidenced
by the language of Shustaak&mdash;the
old heathen chief who had adopted Buck.
"Wuck," he said, "delate siwash. Yacka
tolo konaway nesika kopa klemenhoot."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
(Buck is a genuine Indian. He can beat all
the rest of us lying.)</p>

<p>True to this definition of him, Buck had
built his log house&mdash;a combined dwelling-house,
hotel and store&mdash;thirty miles up the
Stickeen River, opposite the Great Glacier,
right on the boundary line between Alaska
and British Columbia. Here he sold
blankets, guns, groceries and whiskey to the
white miners and to the Indians. When
the Canadian authorities attempted to arrest
him for his illicit traffic he claimed to be on
the American side. When the Alaska custom
officers went after him, he was a Canadian.
Thus for years he had carried on
his crooked business and escaped punishment.</p>

<p>"You know Buck," Louie began, "he
worse siwash dan anybody; but he alltam
make fun odder Injun. One day Kokaekish
come Buck store, buy powder.</p>

<p>"'Where you come?' Buck say.</p>

<p>"'Iskoot,' say Kokaekish, 'make dry dog
salmon. Now too many hootz, me come
back.'</p>

<p>"Buck laugh. 'Eehya-a-ah! You <em>shawat-too</em>
(woman-heart); you coward! What for
you 'fraid hootz? S'pose me, I shootem all.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Buck much laugh.</p>

<p>"Kokaekish, he shame. He head hang
down, so. Buck more laugh. Bimeby
Kokaekish say, 'Buck, you strong heart.
You want killem hootz?'</p>

<p>"Buck big bluff. 'Sure' he say. 'You
show me hootz, me shootem quick.'</p>

<p>"'All light, come along. Me showem you

<p>"Buck shame for back out. He get Winchester,

<p>"'No far. Ict tintin, nesika clap.' (One

<p>"Dey go up Iskoot, mebby tree mile.

<p>"Kokaekish whisper, 'Why you no

<p>"Buck scare stiff. 'Sh-sh-sh! you ol'

<p>"Buck not quite die. He lie flat down.
He's finger count he's bead; he play Maly;

<p>"Kokaekish much laugh. He rub it in.
'You brave man, Buck. You white man&mdash;no

<p>"Bimeby delate polakly (quite dark).

<p>"Now all Injun put shame on Buck face.
'Hey, Buck, you want shootem hootz? You
white man; you brave; no scare nuttin'.
How many hootz you kill?' Buck delate
shame. Mos' keel hese'f. Mebby so, I lak
dat."</p>

<p>"No, Louie," I replied when we had done
laughing, "you are not like Buck. You
would keep your nerve, and at least account
for some of the brown bears."</p>

<p>"Well," he ventured doubtfully, "dis
Winshesser mighty fine gun. I t'ink I try
hootz nex' tam."</p>

<p>A week afterwards Louie came to my
house in great excitement. He knocked repeatedly
before I could get to the door.</p>

<p>"Mista Yuy," he almost shouted, "you
come see my hootz skin. My firs'; my las'
too."</p>

<p>I went with him to the store where several
fine black bear skins were displayed to
an admiring group of whites and natives.
With them was an enormous brown bear
skin, the largest I had ever seen. The fur
was beautiful&mdash;rich in color, thick and
glossy; but it was bloody and badly mussed.
Turning it over I saw that the skin was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
full of holes&mdash;fairly riddled. I counted
seventeen perforations. The larger and
more ragged of the holes marked the exit of
the balls that had ranged clear through the
bear.</p>

<p>"Why, Louie," I exclaimed, "what did
you mean by spoiling this fine skin? It is
like a sieve. You have taken away more
than half its value by shooting it up like
that."</p>

<p>Louie danced about like a monkey&mdash;head,
hands, feet, his whole body gesturing, his
voice rising higher and louder as he went on
with his story.</p>

<p>"You lissen me! I see dis big feller stan'
up all same man. Open place; no big tree.
Maybe hunner ya'd. I say me, 'Louie, you
betta draw good bead dis tam. You shoot
heem straight troo de heart, keel heem dead

<p class="center"><big>OLD SNOOK AND THE COW</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="smcap">n</span> the early missionary days at Fort
Wrangell I had to be a little of everything
to those grown-up, naughty, forest-wise
but world-foolish children of the
islands whom we called Thlingets and
Hydas. I had to be carpenter, and show
them how to build better houses. I had to
be undertaker, and teach them to make coffins
and bury their dead decently. I had to
be farmer, showing them how to raise turnips,
potatoes, cabbage and peas. Once I
gave a package of turnip seed to an old Indian
woman. Towards the close of the
season I went to see her garden. I found
that she had dug a big hole and put all the
turnip seed in it. You can imagine the
result.</p>

<p>Among other things, I had to be doctor
and surgeon to those people. I had never
taken a course at a medical school and knew
very little about medicine or surgery. But
I had books and studied them and did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
best I could. The hardest surgical cases I
had were the result of little love-taps by old
Mr. Hootz, the big brown bear. This bear
is almost identical, except in color, with
<em>ursus horribilis</em>, the grizzly&mdash;he is as large
and ferocious and as hard to kill. Farther
west in Alaska he has the true grizzly color
and is called the silver-tip; but in Southeastern
Alaska he is a rich brown, the female
being much lighter in color than the male.</p>

<p>Once the Indians brought to me a man
who had been foolish enough to shoot a
hootz with his smooth-bore musket. The
bear charged on the Indian, gave him one
tap with his paw and went away. The poor
man presented a horrible appearance. One
eye was torn out, the skin of one side of his
face torn loose and hanging down on his
shoulder, the cheek laid entirely open. I
did my best for him, washed his awful
wound, replaced the skin on his face and
took many stitches; but I couldn't make a
pretty man of him.</p>

<p>Another Indian was hunting in the spring
when he came across a little brown cub, and
thought he would have a fine pet. He had
just caught the little fellow and was trying
to hush its cries, when suddenly the mother-bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
came on him like an avalanche and he
was knocked senseless. When he came to,
hours afterwards, he was unable to move.
The bear had torn off much of his scalp with
the first blow, and then had bitten and
chewed him from head to foot, injuring his
spine, so that he could never walk again. I
dressed twenty-one wounds which the angry
she-bear had given him.</p>

<p>But the greatest example of the strength
and ferocity of the hootz of which I ever
knew was afforded by the adventure of an
Irishman&mdash;a gold-prospector, whom we
called Big Mike. He was a giant in
stature&mdash;over six feet, broad and stalwart,
physically the king of the Cassiar miners.
He was a good-natured, happy-go-lucky
fellow, a typical gold-prospector, making
money very fast at times and spending it
just as fast. Like the most of the miners of
the Cassiar region (which was reached by
traveling by steamboat from Victoria to
Fort Wrangell, then by canoe or river
steamboat up the Stickeen River a hundred
and fifty miles, then across country by
pack-train from one hundred to two hundred
miles, according to the location of the
"diggings"), Mike made Fort Wrangell his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
stopping place to and from the Cassiar,
sometimes wintering there.</p>

<p>One day Dave Flannery, another Irishman,
whose Stickeen wife was a member
of my mission, came hurriedly up to my
house.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd come down and see Big
Mike," he said; "he's hurrt bad."</p>

<p>I found Mike in one of the miners'
shanties on the beach, lying on a bed, entirely
helpless. He could only use his arms,
his legs being paralyzed. This was the story
he told me:</p>

<p>"Me an' me partner, Steve," he began,
"has been prospectin' up the Iskoot." (A
tributary of the Stickeen which runs into it
about twenty-five miles from its mouth.)
"Ye know the Iskoot&mdash;a domd bad river&mdash;little
flat islands thick as spots on a burrd-dog&mdash;th'
river swift an' shaller&mdash;lots av
quick-sands an' rocks everywhere&mdash;th'
shores an' th' islands all matted thick wid
trays an' underbrush&mdash;big fallen trays lyin'
across one anodher an' odher trays growin'
out av thim&mdash;an' alders, willows, divil-clubs
and salmon-berry bushes thicker'n hair on a
cat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, me an' Steve set up our tint by a
trickle av cold water in a side gulch, an'
thought to spind th' sayson prospectin'.
Th' thickets an' brush has scared off
prospectors, an' it's new counthry. A wake
ago Oi made up me pack for four or five days'
prospectin'&mdash;blankets, fly tint, an' some
grub, wid gold-pan, pick, shovel an'
coffee-pot on top.</p>

<p>"Afther an hour o' harrd worrk Oi'd got
mebby half a moil from camp, when Oi come
to Sathan's own pile o' logs an' brush, stuck
up ev'ry-which-way, wid bushes an' divil-clubs
atween. Ye cuddn't see a yarrd. Oi tackled
it as well as Oi cud wid me pack, an'
got onto th' top log. Th' brush wuz that
thick Oi cuddn't see pwhat wuz undher me.
Oi tuk hold av a limb an' swung down into
th' bushes. But before I touched th'
groun'&mdash;gr-r-r&mdash;woof! somethin' of fur an'
iron was all over an' aroun' me; me breath
was squshed out o' me; somethin' was tearin'
the cords out o' me neck an' shouldher, an'
me back was bruk intoirly.</p>

<p>"Oi've some repitation as a sthrong man,
an' Oi've niver met th' man Oi cuddent
down in a fair wrassle; but this thing thut
had me didn't play fair. He tuk a foul hold
o' me when Oi wasn't lookin', an' niver guv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

down me left arrum wuz straight up, aholt
av th' limb, an' the right wan wuz steadyin'
me pack. Th' brute pinned that fast, an'
Oi cud no more move it than a baby cud
lift a ton.</p>

<p>"When Oi got me sinses gathered togither,
an' knowed Oi wuz in the clutches av
a bear, me dandher riz an' Oi thought av me
knoif. 'Twas in a scabbard on me roight
hip, an' that han' was hild toight agin me

all stove in.</p>

<p>"Oi tried to twist aroun' an' git me knoif
wid me lift han', but it was loik a mouse
thryin' to pry off th' paws av a cat. Me fate
wuz aff th' groun' an' Oi had no purchase.
At las' Oi got ahold av th' handle av th'
knoif. Jist as Oi felt me sinses lavin' me Oi
got th' knoif an' begun to dig it wid all me
strent into th' bear's belly, workin' upwards
an' thryin' fer his heart. Thin ev'rythin'

<p>"Whin Oi come to th' sun was hoigh. Ut

Oi throied to git up, but me legs wuz

<p>"Well, there Oi wuz, undher all th' logs
an' brush, an' down in a little hollow in th'
muck&mdash;an' helpless. 'Twas too fur away to
make Steve hear. Oi hollered as best Oi
cud, but 'twas no use. Th' bear hadn't left
me much breath. Then Oi thought Oi'd
thry annyhow. Me arrums wuz good, an'
th' bushes wuz thick, so Oi begun to pull
meself along troo th' muck by me hands,
usin' me knoif whin th' bushes blocked me.
It tuck me two hours to gain th' top av th'
hill in soight av th' camp, an' anither to
make a flag av a bit o' ma shurrt an' wave it
on a pole so that Steve cud see it. He drug
me down to camp, put me in th' canoe, an'
here Oi am wid all th' man squose out av
me, bad cess to th' bear. Ef anny one says
anny man c'n fight anny bear wid his two
han's an' bate it, tell 'im from me he's a
loiarr."</p>

<p>We raised a purse and sent Big Mike on
the monthly steamboat to Victoria. He
lived several years. They gave him the
position of watchman on the wharves, and
we used to see him&mdash;a pathetic figure,
creeping slowly about the dock, first with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
pair of crutches and then with a cane. He was
never a man again, after his encounter with
the hootz.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="totem" id="totem"><img class="border" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;" src="images/image9.jpg" width="600" height="372" alt="Native Houses, Showing Totem Poles" />
</a></div>
<p class="center">Native Houses, Showing Totem Poles</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 2em;">In such a house Snook lived</p>

<p>But although the hootz was so strong and
so fierce there was in almost every Indian
tribe one who would attack and kill him.
In the Stickeen tribe this man's name was
Snook. Tilly, our star pupil and my
interpreter, proudly pointed him out, one day
when I was down in the Indian village, as
her granduncle and the head of the family.</p>

<p>I had never before seen Snook. He never
came to church or to my house. He must
have been sixty or sixty-five years old&mdash;a
great, stalwart, big-boned savage with a
huge head and a tremendous jaw. He was
almost always absent from Fort Wrangell,
hunting in the mountains or fishing among
the islands. "My gran'fader, the greatest
hootz-hunter in the world," was Tilly's
introduction.</p>

<p>It was on the occasion of a visit with
Tilly to the community house of her family.
As she spoke she went behind the carved
totemic corner post which supported the
roof, and brought forth old Snook's most
valuable and proudest possession. It was a
beautiful spear. The shaft was of crabapple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
wood and eight feet long, thick
enough for a good grip, and polished until
it shone like brown granite. It was carved
all over with the totemic images of the
eagle and the brown bear, the totems of
Snook's family. The head was made of a
large steel rasp and was a foot and a half
long, five inches across in the widest place,
finely pointed, the edges sharp as a razor.
The handle of the spear-head was let into
the end of the shaft in a very ingenious way,
and secured by many tightly wrapped turns
of a cord of deer-sinew. It was a most perfect
and ferocious weapon. I learned that
the chief of another tribe had offered a slave,
whose value was five hundred blankets, for
the spear, and his offer had been refused.</p>

<p>All efforts to get Snook to talk about his
hunting exploits were unavailing. He only
grunted and went on with some carving
with which he was occupied. But Sam Tahtain,
a member of Snook's family, who was
noted for his powers of oratory, described
most graphically, in a mixture of Chinook,
Thlinget and bad English, Snook's way of
killing the big bears. He acted it so
perfectly that even if I had not understood a
word, the scene would have stood out very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
vividly before my mental vision. He
showed the hootz grubbing among mossy
logs and flirting the salmon out of a swift
mountain stream; then Snook came in sight,
creeping stealthily through the forest, a
flintlock musket in one hand, his spear in
the other. From that point the story grew
more animated and the gestures more rapid
to the climax. I can best tell it in the
present tense:</p>

<p>The bear hears a stick snap and catches
a faint human odor; he stands up on his
hind feet to investigate. His lips are drawn
back from his big teeth, and he snarls a
question.</p>

<p>The man dodges behind a tree; creeps
closer&mdash;cautiously flits from tree to tree&mdash;moves
slowly out from a sheltering trunk&mdash;sinks
on one knee&mdash;raises his gun&mdash;aims.
"<em>Bang!</em>" from the gun,&mdash;"wah-a-ah-gr-r-r!"
from the bear. The bear whirls round and
round, biting his wound; then he charges
straight for the man, his teeth champing, his
jaws slavering.</p>

<p>The man throws away the gun and takes
his spear in both hands. He steps boldly
out in the open and stands still, his left foot
advanced, his spear slanting upwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
braced for the shock. The bear comes
galumphing on, his hair on end, his sideways
strut showing his anger and his readiness for
the battle.</p>

<p>When within a few feet of the man the
bear stops short with a startling "Woof!"
and stands upright on his hind feet. The
man knows this habit of the hootz, and
seizes the opportunity. He springs forward
before the bear is steadied on his two feet
and thrusts mightily with his spear. The
bear strikes viciously at the man and howls
hoarsely. A stream of red gushes out from
the wide wound. Now the bear attacks, his
fangs gleaming, his long claws standing
stiffly out. He jumps and strikes and
slashes with his teeth at the man.</p>

<p>The man is alert&mdash;firm and sure on his
feet&mdash;quick as lightning, yet steady. He
dodges and leaps about the bear, feinting
and thrusting. Again and again the spear
goes home. The froth from the bear's jaws
is bloody now, while the man's face is
covered with drops of sweat. The breath
of both comes in gasps. The air seems
full of violent motion and raucous
sounds. At every fresh wound the bear
howls&mdash;"wa-a-ah"&mdash;this changes immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to a vicious growl as he rears on his
hind feet again and rushes to the
fray. The man begins to shout his
war-cry&mdash;"hoohooh&mdash;hoohooh"&mdash;as he jabs
his terrible weapon into the bear's breast.</p>

<p>The bear is visibly weakening. His eyes
grow dim, his rushes and blows have less
steel and lightning in them. The man begins
to taunt him, "Oh, you big-chief
hootz&mdash;I thought you brave man&mdash;strong
man. You no brave&mdash;no strong. You just
like baby. Why you no stand up, fight like
man?"</p>

<p>At last the bear, sick and faint with loss
of blood, but game to the end, stands with
paws outstretched, swaying like a drunken
man. The man comes close, and, bending
back to gain force for his blow, thrusts
upward and forward with all his strength,
striking just under the bear's breast bone
and buries the spear-head, splitting the heart
in two. Over on his back topples the great
beast, his paws feebly twitching, his last
breath bringing with it a great rush of
blood.</p>

<p>The man, as soon as he can recover
breath, puts his foot on the bear's neck,
singing in quaint minor strain a brief song<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of triumph. Then he hastens to prop the
bear's mouth open with a stick, to let his
spirit go forth in peace, and he also places
between the dying jaws a piece of dried
salmon, that the bear may not lack food
when he goes to join the <em>hoots-kwany</em>&mdash;the
bear-people, in that spirit land of forests and
mountains to which all brown bears, good
and bad, must go.</p>

<p>Sam Tahtain was a little man, in striking
contrast with his giant brother, Snook, but
he entered into his recital with infinite
energy, dancing about the floor, striking and
thrusting, acting the bear's part and then
the man's, shouting and growling out his
words; and when he had finished, his own
face was bathed in perspiration. His acting
was an artless piece of art, very perfect
in its way; and it certainly thrilled the
Indians who had drawn around in an eager
circle as the recitation proceeded, their
fervent indrawn exclamations of wonder and
admiration supplying the most genuine applause.</p>

<p>But I must confess that the antics of the
little man, and his evident pride in his own
performance, struck me as irresistibly funny;
and I could not help recalling a verse I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
learned when a boy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Little man with the wild, wild eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Man with the long, long hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you dance about the floor?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why do you beat the air?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you howl and mutter so?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why do you shake your fist?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Said the little man, in a deep, deep voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I'm an el-o-cu-tion-ist!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the Indians saw nothing funny in Sam's
oratory&mdash;it thrilled them through and
through. Even old Snook, the hero of the
story, ceased his carving, fixing his eyes
intently on the speaker, and rewarding him
with a fervent "<em>Kluh-yukeh!</em>" To exactly
translate that exclamation will require a
paraphrase&mdash;"My, but that was good!"</p>

<p>But Tilly thought only of the glory of her
granduncle. Her eyes shone with pride,
and she whispered to me, "Isn't my gran'fader,
Snook, just the bravest man you ever
heard of? Why, he isn't afraid of anything."</p>

<p>The other Indians also yielded Snook the
palm for courage and strength. They
looked upon him as a sort of Indian superman,
lauding him in their speeches, and being
careful not to offend him. He was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
hero of the Stickeens.</p>

<p>And, indeed, I was much of the same
opinion. Certainly a man who would stand
up, single-handed, to a grizzly and kill him
with a spear, must have unqualified nerve
and courage. Surely nothing on earth
could frighten a mighty bear-hunter like
that.</p>

<p>Well, listen. A few days after this visit
to Snook's house I was sitting in my house,
which was within the stockade of the old
fort. The posts of this stockade, some
twelve feet high and firmly spiked together,
had been put in place about sixteen years
before, when the fort was first established.
Although many of the posts were rotting,
the circle enclosing the parade ground,
barracks, hospital and officers' quarters was
still unbroken. Our house was one of the
old officers' dwellings and not far from the
gateway which led "up the beach" towards
the Indian village of temporary houses in
which the "foreign Indians"&mdash;those from
distant tribes&mdash;encamped. On the other
side of the fort another gateway led "down
the beach," through the town with its stores
and white man's houses, to the large community
houses of the Stickeens. To go from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
one Indian town to the other you had to
pass through the fort.</p>

<p>It was a lovely, sunny day in midsummer.
Everything was peaceful about the old fort.
School was in session in the old hospital, our
little children were playing on the grass,
and our old cow, "Spot," was feeding in the
gateway.</p>

<p>This cow was a little black and white
Holstein which the ladies of Pennsylvania
had purchased for Mrs. Young's training-school,
and to supply our babies and the
native babies with fresh milk. She was the
first cow which had been brought to Fort
Wrangell, and was a great curiosity and
wonder to the Indians. The Thlingets had
no name for cattle, because these animals
were not known in Alaska; so they adopted
the Chinook name&mdash;moosmoos&mdash;and, owing
to the Thlingets' inability to pronounce any
consonant that brings the lips together, they
called it "wusoos."</p>

<p>Our little "wusoos" was gentle and tame
as a kitten. Our children used to hang onto
her tail, and feed her bunches of grass and
leaves of cabbage. Once I came upon a
group that made me laugh. "Spot" was
lying down and placidly chewing her cud;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Abby, aged five, was seated between the
cow's horns; while Alaska (Lassie), who
was three, with her little dog, Jettie, in her
arms, was sprawling on Spot's back.</p>

<p>This peaceful summer's morning the cow
was cropping the grass by the gate. Suddenly
the silence was shattered by a strong
Indian voice, pitched high through fear,
calling to me: "<em>Uh-eedydashee; uh-eedydashee,
uh-Ankow; uh-eedydashee!</em>" (Help me; help
me, my chief; help me!)</p>

<p>I ran quickly out of the house and through
the gateway in the direction of the cries,
which were growing more agonizing. I
thought somebody was being murdered. I
rushed past "Spot," who was calmly munching
grass, undisturbed by the hullabaloo.
At first I could see nobody; then I
discovered the huge bulk of old Snook, the
hootz-hunter, crouching behind a stump.
His face was as pale as its coating of smoke
and grease would permit, and he was shaking
like a leaf.</p>

<p>"Why, Snook!" I cried in Thlinget,
"what's the matter? Is anything wrong in
the Indian village?"</p>

<p>He pointed a trembling finger towards the
cow and quavered, "Drive that thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
away!"</p>

<p>The thought of that famous old bear-hunter,
scared to death at my gentle old
cow, was too much for me, and I burst into
a roar of laughter. When I had recovered
my powers of speech and locomotion I
walked to "Spot" and put my arm over her
neck.</p>

<p>"This is a <em>shawat wusoos</em>" (a woman cow),
I explained. "She will not hurt anybody.
See how kind and gentle she is."</p>

<p>Snook was unconvinced. His eyes were
fixed in fascinated terror upon "Spot," and
he dodged at every motion of her head.</p>

<p>"Eehya-a-ah!" he answered in contempt,
"she knows white man; she doesn't know
Indian. See the sharp horns on her head!"
and he refused to come away from the
shelter of the stump until I had driven
"Spot" away some distance; and even then
he sidled past, eyeing her apprehensively
and then hurrying through the gateway and
across the parade ground with the air of one
who has escaped deadly peril.</p>

<p>The memory of Snook and the cow has
often braced me up when I was tempted to
retreat from the path of duty, because I did
not know what was in the gateway, or because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of unfamiliar obstacles. It is the unknown
that terrifies us. If we march right
up to the bugaboos that stand across our
way, we will find the terrible horned monster
change into something no more harmful
than a gentle old cow.</p>

<h2><a name="ChVII" id="ChVII">VII</a></h2>

<p class="center"><big>NINA AND THE BEARS</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span><span class="smcap">ll</span> these stories are true, in their
essential points. In some of them,
however, I have to change or suppress
the names of persons and towns, because
the characters introduced are still
living, and might not like publicity. That
is the case in this story.</p>

<p>Ever since the great gold stampede of
1897 into the Klondike, it has been my duty,
as it certainly has been my pleasure, to
follow the new gold stampedes into different
parts of Alaska, and be at the beginning of
most of the new gold camps and towns of
the great Territory of the Northwest. Of
course I began preaching as soon as I arrived
at one of these camps, holding my first
services on log piles, under the trees, in tents
or saloons or lodging houses&mdash;wherever I
could gather together a congregation.</p>

<p>Always, the next thing was to start a
Sunday-school, if there were any children in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
camp, or at least a Bible class, if there were
only grown people. I always had hymn-books
and a baby-organ along, and was sure
of finding people to play the organ and sing.
The gold-seekers are not all roughs and
toughs, as some people think, but just such
people as may be seen in the States, and a
large proportion of them are Christians.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of these gold stampedes
occurred in the heart of Alaska&mdash;in
the center of a great wilderness until then
unexplored. A rich vein of gold was struck
deep down in the frozen ground. The news
spread, and soon thousands of eager gold-seekers
from all parts of Alaska, from the
Pacific States, from Canada, and later from
all parts of the United States came over the
mountains from the coast, down the Yukon
from Dawson City, up the Yukon from
Nome and from other directions; traveling
by steamboat, poling boat and canoe on the
rivers, and with dog-sled, horse-sled and
hand-sled in the winter over the mountains,
and with packs on their backs and guns in
their hands in the summer.</p>

<p>Of course I was with the crowd. I never
liked to miss the fun of a great scramble like
that. When I got to the big new camp I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
set up my tent and began to prepare a
preaching-place and to advertise a meeting
for the next Sunday by putting up posters
on stumps and trees. I also called the children
to come and be organized into a Sunday-school.
About twenty children came the first Sunday.</p>

<p>Among them was a pretty little Swedish
girl, named Nina. She had blue eyes, flaxen
hair and rosy cheeks, and was about twelve
years old. She won my heart at once, and
soon we were great chums. She was so
bright and pleasant and sweet, and such a
fearless and intelligent outdoor girl, that
one could not help loving her. She was always
at Sunday-school and church, always
knew her lessons, and sang so heartily and
tunefully that people turned their heads
to see her, and her sunny smile drew
answering smiles even from care-worn
faces.</p>

<p>I soon found that among Nina's
accomplishments she was already a good shot
with both rifle and shotgun; and when the
snow began to fall in October I took her with
me on a couple of rabbit-hunts, and her glee
at getting the biggest bag of snow-shoe
rabbits was very enjoyable. Rabbits formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
our principal meat-supply that winter.</p>

<p>When the cold weather of November
covered the rivers, creeks and lakes with ice
and carpeted the hills and valleys with snow,
a big stampede occurred away from the
town of log houses into which the camp of
tents had grown. Almost every one who
had a dog-team and sled packed up an outfit
of food, blankets, tent and sheet-iron
stove, and "mushed" away into the mountains,
prospecting for gold. If no dogs were
available, two men, or sometimes a man and
his wife, would harness themselves to a sled
with their outfit aboard, and, depending
upon their guns for their meat supply, would
cheerily set forth into the trackless wild,
following the water-courses until they found
a likely-looking creek, when they would halt
and build a snug log cabin, and spend the
winter prospecting. To those who had
courage, some knowledge of woodcraft and
love of nature, this adventurous life was very
enticing. Thousands of men in Alaska, to
this day, spend their summers in the towns,
working at their trades or professions, and
then, on the approach of winter, invest the
money they have earned in an outfit of
provisions, tools and ammunition, and bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
themselves in the wilderness again. It is a
great life; and I have often felt strongly
tempted to leave everything and join these
brave spirits for a winter's stay in the
McKinley range of mountains.</p>

<p>One day, about the middle of November
of that year, little Nina came into our house
and threw herself into our arms, crying as if
her heart would break.</p>

<p>"Why, Nina dear," asked my wife,
"what is the matter? Is any one sick or
dead?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she sobbed, "but I can't come
to Sunday-school any more. Papa and
Mamma and I are going away off into the
mountains to-morrow, and we'll never come
back here again."</p>

<p>We petted and soothed her, the best comfort
I could give her being the thought of
the great hunting adventures that were before
her. So the wilderness swallowed up
my brave little friend, and for eight years I
had no word of her. By that time I was at
another large gold camp, in a distant part of
the great Yukon Valley.</p>

<p>I was the only minister in a region larger
than Pennsylvania. My parish extended
from two to five hundred miles in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
directions from the camp in which I wintered.
That winter I traveled with my dogs
between two and three thousand miles, in
preaching and exploring trips. Magazines,
papers and books sent me by churches,
Sunday-schools, Boys' Scouts, and women's
missionary societies, I found three hundred
miles from my central reading room, in
miners' and trappers' cabins and in
roadhouses to which I had sent them.</p>

<p>About the middle of the winter I was
delighted to get a letter from Nina. It was
written from a point about two hundred and
fifty miles distant, in that great game-stocked
region which lies west of the Alaska
Range, of which Mt. McKinley, "The Top
of the Continent," is the highest peak. It
was a cheery, girlish letter&mdash;just such an
one as I might have expected from
Nina&mdash;grown-up. It told me of her marriage,
two years before, to a young man whom
I had known&mdash;one who had loved her
when she was a little girl, had followed
her and her parents to the western wilderness,
waited patiently for her to grow up,
and, now that they were married, seemed to
her all that was admirable and complete in
manhood. It was her one romance and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
very sweet and perfect.</p>

<p>Nina and her husband were living in a
large cabin on one of the trails that led from
the Interior to the Coast. Nina called it a
roadhouse, and, though low and dark, with
only poles for floor, and pole-bunks for beds,
it was fitted for the accommodation of a
dozen travelers. Nina was queen of a wide
realm. Her cabin was a hundred and
twenty-five miles from that of the nearest
white woman. They were two hundred
miles from the nearest store. They were in
the heart of the richest game region of
North America&mdash;the western foot-hills of
the Alaska Range. They were prospectors
for gold in the summer; farmers, raising
their own potatoes and vegetables and
wheat for their chickens; trappers during
the winter; hunters all the time; and
hotel-keepers during the six months when snow
and frozen streams and lakes lured travelers
along the lonely trail.</p>

<p>There was in Nina's letter, however, no
hint of loneliness; rather a joyful tone of
contentment, as one of God's favored
creatures; and of comradeship with the
things about her&mdash;the mountains, the forests
and the myriads of animals, small and great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
She invited me to come and make them a
long visit and have a big hunt. Her letter
also spoke of the one need in her life that I
could supply&mdash;Bibles, books and magazines.</p>

<p>Very few travelers came my way who had
passed Nina's that winter, but from most
of them I heard of my little chum, and always
in terms of enthusiastic praise.</p>

<p>"I am a city man," said a young lawyer
from Seattle, "and am in this wild land just
long enough to make my stake and get back
to the rattle of the street-cars. The 'call of
the wild' has no allurement for me. There
is just one thing that could make me settle
down in Alaska, and that is to find such a
mate as that little woman."</p>

<p>"Know her?" repeated a rugged, black-eyed
man of thirty whom I had met on the
Chilcoot Pass in '97. "Who doesn't? Say;
she's a great woman. Why, I'd go out of
my way a hundred miles, any time, just to
see her smile, and to taste her grouse-pie or
roast sheep. Tell you what she did this last
trip: As I swung into the edge of their
clearin' a pair of sharp-tailed grouse flew up
to the top of a dry spruce, a hundred yards
from the cabin. Nina was complainin' that
she had no makin's of grouse pie in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
house, knowin' my likin' for the same. I
told her about the two I'd scared up. 'Lend
me a shotgun,' I said, 'and I'll go back and
try for a shot at them.' We stepped to the
door for a look. There set the two grouse
on the spruce, lookin' like robins agin the
sky. Nina took down a twenty-two rifle
from the wall and put some 'extra-long'
shells in the magazine. I thought she was
goin' to give the gun to me, and I planned to
sneak back till I got under the birds before
riskin' a shot; but she stood in the doorway
and swung the rifle up quick and easy.
Crack, crack! and dogged if them chickens
didn't come tumblin' right down. I never
seen such shootin'. Then she slipped on
her snow-shoes and went and got the grouse
and made me my pie. She's sure a little bit
of 'all right.'"</p>

<p>I asked him if he had seen the magazines
and Bibles I had sent her. With a sheepish
grin he took out of his pocket a little red
Testament, and handed it to me. I saw his
name on the fly-leaf with her initials under
it.</p>

<p>"First I've carried since I was a kid," he
confessed. "And she made me promise to
<em>read</em> it! A woman that can be a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
little Christian in a place like that, and a
dead game sport, too, can make me do most
anything. Joe [Nina's husband] is a lucky
guy."</p>

<p>Naturally such reports as these made me
all the more anxious to see this queen of the
wilderness again. The necessity of taking
a seven-hundred-mile trip to the Coast in
March gave me the opportunity.</p>

<p>Oh, boys, you'll never know the real joy
of living till you take a winter trip with dog-sled
in Alaska. The keen, fine air, lung-filling,
invigorating; your dogs yelping with
eagerness, their feet twinkling, the sled
screaming its delight; frost-diamonds sparkling
from every branch, frost-symphonies
played by the ice-harps under your feet;
your own struggle, achievement, triumph,
against and over the cold, the difficulties of
the trail, the long miles.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The morning breaks, the stars grow pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your huskies leap, shrill shrieks the sled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You follow free with flying tread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A joy to live! What joy! to thread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fluted ribbon of the trail."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was near the sunset of a beautiful,
bright day that I swung into Joe's clearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
For three days I had been headed almost
directly towards Dinali&mdash;The Great One,
and Dinah's Wife (Mt. McKinley and Mt.
Foraker). Higher and higher these majestic
mountains heaved their mighty shoulders.
The country became more broken and
rugged. Lesser mountains raised their
white heads all around me. Only a few
inches of snow covered the ground instead
of the six to ten feet that prevailed farther
west. The character of the trees had
changed&mdash;more birch, cottonwood and other
deciduous timber; less tamarack, hemlock
and swamp spruce.</p>

<p>Signs of abundant life were everywhere.
Fox, wolf, lynx and wolverine tracks
criss-crossed the snow in all directions; great
moose tracks going in a straight line, and
the imprint of thousands of caribou hoofs
crossing and obliterating each other, but
keeping in the same general direction
showed the presence of abundance of big
game; while grouse, ptarmigan and rabbit
tracks were so numerous that my dogs were
kept excited and on the "keen jump" every
minute.</p>

<p>On the bank of a small river, in a clearing
of a couple of acres cut out of a forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of great fir and cedar trees, stood Joe's
log-cabin roadhouse. Enough of the big trees
had been left standing to shade the house.
In front of it were a dozen cozy log
dog-kennels, and behind it was a garden enclosed
in a picket and wire fence.</p>

<p>As soon as "Leader's" bells gave shrill
notice of my arrival the door flew open, a
bright little figure in gingham and moccasins,
with yellow hair flying and blue eyes
sparkling, rushed at me, and I received the
first good hug that I had experienced since
leaving my wife and daughters in the East
a year before.</p>

<p>A cheery voice cried, "Oh, you dear old
man, you. I've been watching for you every
day for two weeks. I was so afraid you
weren't coming!"</p>

<p>Joe's welcome, though not so demonstrative,
was none the less hearty. It was
worth dog-mushing two hundred and fifty
miles to have such a reception. As soon
as I stepped into the house I was made
keenly aware that I was in the home of
hunters and trappers. In all my wide
experience of wilderness homes I had never
seen one like this. The long, low cabin had
two rooms. The smaller was kitchen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
dining-room, having a sheet-iron range and
home-made tables, shelves and chairs. The
larger room had a good sized sheet-iron
heating stove in the center, and was almost
filled with bunks in tiers of three each, built
in double rows the length of the room. A
little chamber enclosed with snowy caribou
buck-skin, the skins sewn together most
skillfully with sinew thread, was Nina's
bedroom. The poles which formed the floors
had been hewn and laid so carefully that
they looked like boards. The tables and
shelves were of whipsawed lumber, every
article showing painstaking skill.</p>

<p>"Joe and I made the cabin and everything
in and about it, all ourselves," Nina
boasted.</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed, "you two rolled
up these heavy logs, without any help?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed. We used block-and-tackle.
It isn't so hard when you know how; and it
was great fun."</p>

<p>"But the lumber for the doors and tables
and window-sash&mdash;it's so true and smooth
and beautiful; how did you get that?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Whipsawed and hand-planed it all," she
replied. "You see, we came here two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
years ago this month, just after we were
married. The Government was surveying
this trail, and we thought we'd build this
roadhouse and pick up a few dollars taking
care of travelers. But chiefly we chose this
place because it was so beautiful and such
a game country. Then it has never been
prospected for gold.</p>

<p>"Joe and I each had a good dog-team and
sled when we were married. We loaded the
sleds with tools, hardware, stoves and dishes,
glass for the windows, some flour, sugar,
beans and a few other groceries, and
brought our traps and plenty of ammunition
for our guns. It was hard breaking trail
through the deep snow on the east side of
the Alaska Range, but nice going on this
side. We mushed the two hundred and
fifty miles from the coast in two weeks; and
had some time for trapping before warm
weather."</p>

<p>"How do you get 'outside' in the summer
time?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"We can't, and we don't need to. We
spent that first summer building this house,
making garden, gathering berries, drying
fish, hunting and getting ready for the winter.
Almost all our wants are supplied right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
here. From the middle of April till the
middle of October we don't see a human
being, except now and then an Indian, or a
stray prospector."</p>

<p>"What a lonesome life!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Now, Doctor, I know you don't mean
that," protested Nina. "Why, this is the
most companionable place in the world. It
is full of friendly creatures. The winter
before I was married I spent three months in
San Francisco. I nearly died, I was so
lonely and homesick. I'd meet thousands
of people on the streets every day, and not
get a word or smile from one of them. I
wouldn't give my little 'Red' for the whole
crowd."</p>

<p>"Who's Red?" I asked.</p>

<p>Nina leaned forward and made a squeaking
noise with her lips. Instantly a little
furry creature of a bright scarlet color, with
a short tail, jumped out of a box in the
corner, ran to her and up her hand and arm
to her shoulder and then down to her knee,
where he stood stiffly erect like a soldier at
attention. He was so quick and comical in
his motions and so full of tricks that he kept
us laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had three Reds," explained Nina, "but
a weasel got two of them before I got the
weasel. I have had many other pets besides
the wood-mice. There isn't a creature
in all the forest that would do me harm unless
I hurt it first. And I don't have a
grudge against any of them, except the
hawks and owls that come after my
chickens."</p>

<p>The most striking feature about the cabin,
however, was the abundance and variety of
furs and other trophies of the chase.
Adorning and almost covering one end of
the room was an enormous moose head.
At the other end was a wonderful caribou
head. Over the windows were beautiful
heads of the white mountain sheep, the
bighorn of the Northwest.</p>

<p>But the pelts! Great bunches of mink,
marten, fisher, otter, muskrat and beaver;
scores of red fox, with here and there a
priceless black or silver fox; lynx, wolf,
wolverine and black bear.</p>

<p>"We have four lines of traps, each five
miles long," explained Nina; "and Joe and
I each take two lines every other day, spending
the alternate days caring for the skins.
We are making bear traps now, getting
ready for Bruin when he comes out of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
den. We have about four thousand dollars'
worth of furs caught this winter, and
we'll make it five before warm weather."</p>

<p>But the most imposing objects of all in
the cabin were two tremendous rugs&mdash;the
skins of the <em>ursus gigas</em> or Kodiak bear&mdash;the
largest of existing carnivorous mammals.
Joe had learned something of taxidermy,
and the heads were nicely preserved, the big
teeth and claws showing, the skins being
lined with red blankets. The largest of
these rugs was over twelve feet long, the
distance from nose to tail over ten feet, the
lateral spread being almost as great. The
fur was a rich brown in color, deep, thick
and soft.</p>

<p>At my exclamation of wonder and admiration,
Joe began eagerly to tell me the story
of the rugs; but his wife stopped him.</p>

<p>"Better wait till after supper, Joe," she
said.</p>

<p>Ah, that supper! The supreme physical
pleasure of it lingers in my memory still.
Moose soup with potatoes, turnips, carrots
and onions from their garden in it; fresh
grayling, caught in the fall and frozen;
ruffed grouse pie; roast mountain sheep&mdash;the
best meat that grows; omelet made of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
eggs laid that day; moose-nose cheese,
delicately pickled; fine sour-dough bread
with raspberry jam and currant jelly; pie
made of fresh blueberries, the berries having
been picked in the fall and preserved by the
simple process of pouring water on them
and letting them freeze. All of these viands,
except the bread, being the products of
Nina's labor or marksmanship, made them
doubly sweet. Where else in the world
could you get a meal like that&mdash;or the
appetite to devour it all?</p>

<p>"Well," began Joe, when, sated, I lay
back in the easy-chair curiously fashioned
of moose horns, while the young couple
washed the dishes, "I'm mighty proud of
them rugs. They're Nina's, both of 'em,
and I reckon there's no other girl in the
world would of tackled the job she did, and
got away with it. It scares me every time
I think of it, and I don't know whether I'd
oughter scold her or pet her up."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" protested his wife; "you
know you'd have done exactly as I did if
you'd been here."</p>

<p>"Maybe I would," he retorted, "but I
wouldn't of let <em>you</em> take that risk."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was the first of last November," he
resumed. "I'd taken the two sleds and all
the dogs, as soon as I thought the ice was
strong enough, and I'd gone two hundred
miles to the store at Ophir to lay in our
winter's outfit. The ice towards the coast
wasn't strong enough to make safe mushin',
and Nina was all alone here for more'n three
weeks. I knowed she would make the reg'lar
round of the traps and keep things goin'
just as usual. She's never learned to be
afraid&mdash;that girl.</p>

<p>"Well, one mornin' she was gettin' breakfast,
when she heard a little noise outside.
She opened the door, and there, within
twenty-five feet of her, were three big
Kodiak bears. Two of them stood up on
their hin' feet when she opened the door,
while the other kept smellin' around for
grub."</p>

<p>"Goodness, Nina!" I exclaimed. "What
was your first thought when you saw the big
brutes so close?"</p>

<p>"Well," she answered, smiling, "my first
thought was, 'What beautiful rugs those
are on the backs of the bears! I want those
rugs.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," Joe went on, "and so she stepped
slowly back, inch by inch into the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and softly closed the door so as not to <em>scare</em>
the bears&mdash;they as big as a house and her
such a leetle mite of a thing. She took
down that 30-40 Winchester, there, and
filled the magazine full (it chambers ten);
and then she done a plumb foolish thing. I
know darned well what I'd 'a' done. I'd
'a' poked the moss out between the logs,
there, and stuck my rifle through and had
some 'vantage."</p>

<p>"What did Nina do?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, she threw the door wide open and
stepped right out in front of it. Up came all
three bears, this time, on their hind feet.
Nina's lightnin' on the snap shot, and before
the big he-bear was straightened up he got
it right between the eyes. Down he
tumbled, and the other two was out of sight
around the kennel there before she could
throw another shell into the gun and aim."
Joe pointed to a log dog-house about two
rods in front of the door.</p>

<p>"Nina raced pell-mell past the kennel to
get another shot, and there she saw the big
she-bear, standin' up behind the dog-house,
awaitin' for her, not a gun's length away.
Nina swung around and fired pointblank
into the bear's breast. It went down on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
all-fours and came for her with open mouth.
There was nothing for it but to keep on
shootin'. She worked the lever of her gun
mighty fast. She put five bullets into the
beast before she quieted it. She never saw
the third bear again."</p>

<p>"Why, Nina!" I cried, as soon as I could
get my breath. "You foolish child! Your
escape was miraculous! It frightens me to
hear Joe tell of it. Weren't you dreadfully
scared when you saw that great brute jump
at you like that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," laughed the girl. "I was too
busy to get scared. But I was awfully
provoked because the other one got away."</p>

<p>Other details of Nina's great adventure
followed&mdash;how it took her three days to skin
the two bears, she having to climb a tree to
adjust the block and tackle so as to move the
heavy carcases; and how Joe "blubbered"
when he got home and saw them, and knew
the peril his beloved had encountered.</p>

<p>Nina is an exceptional woman, but still
she is truly a type. There is something in
"that great, big, broad land, way up yonder,"
that stiffens the moral fiber, enlarges the
spirit and makes the people unafraid. The
white settlers of Alaska, while by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
all saints, are as a class the strongest,
bravest and most resourceful people I know. I
have not heard from my brave little chum
for several years. I presume she is still
living her joyous, fearless, Christian life in
what John Muir used to call my "beautiful,
fruitful wilderness." Here's to her; God
bless her!</p>

<p class="center"><big>THE ABSURD WALRUS</big></p>


<p><span class="dropcap">L</span><span class="smcap">ewis</span> C<span class="smcap">aroll's</span> famous lines
about the Walrus and the Carpenter
will always hold their place at the
very top of humorous poems. For besides
being funny they have a quality of truth
which the careless reader little suspects:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The time has come," the walrus said,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"To talk of many things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shoes and ships and sealing wax,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of cabbages and kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why the sea is boiling hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And whether pigs have wings."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The very few men who have been acquainted
with the walrus in his native haunts know
that the author of "Alice in Wonderland" in
these verses "hits the nail on the head,"
and, perhaps unwittingly, gives an insight
into the true character of the walrus as the
most inconsistent, grotesque and absurd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
all beasts.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune the summer of
1913 to be one of a company of six hunters
on board the three-masted power schooner,
<em>P. J. Abler</em>, which sailed along the Alaskan
and Siberian coasts for six thousand miles
and pounded its way northward into the
Arctic ice-pack to within sixteen degrees of
the Pole.</p>

<p>The ship itself was of unusual pattern.
Her owner called her the <em>Mudhen</em>. Her
three masts stood stiff and straight in a row
and were the same height. Her lines were
not particularly elegant, and her small engine
could only push her through calm seas
at the rate of five miles an hour. But she
was a comfortable ship and had one quality
in particular which overbalanced all the
drawbacks and made her the boat for us&mdash;she
was built for "bucking ice." She had
extra heavy timbers, especially about her
bow. In spite of her slowness, she was an
ideal craft for venturing into Arctic
ice-floes. She would come at a good speed, bow
on, against a huge berg and bring up with a
jar that would shake her as a rat shaken by
a terrier, and send your plate of polar bear
meat into your lap. Then she would recover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
from her backward bounce and calmly
proceed on her way undented and unharmed.
Mr. Scull of Philadelphia, who has sailed the
world over, could never get used to bumping
the ice. He and I would be bent over the
chess board, absorbed in a difficult situation,
when&mdash;bang! would go the schooner against
the ice, and recoil, trembling like a hound.
I would grab for the tottering chessmen,
while Scull would jump right into the air
with his hair standing straight up on each
side of his bald pate like the ears of a horned
owl. He would rush frantically out of the
cabin door, lean far over the vessel's side,
train his big eye-glasses on the ship's bow
and watch for signs of her filling. Then he
would come back muttering strange words
in any of the five or six languages of which
he is the master, and resume his study of
the game, only to repeat the performance at
the next bump. "Oh!" he would say, "it
hurts me more than it hurts the ship";
which was undoubtedly true. I always had
better luck in chess with Scull when we were
bucking ice.</p>

<p>The personnel of our party was like some
landscapes, varied and interesting. The
commander of the expedition and its manager,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
was Captain Kleinschmidt, sailor,
miner, hunter, author and moving-picture
man. He chartered the <em>Abler</em> and hired
her crew, who were as cosmopolitan as it is
possible for crew to be&mdash;the captain, a
Swede; the mate, a Dane; the engineers
(brothers) German-Americans; the cook, a
"Jap"; the crew composed of one American,
one Russian and five Eskimos. There
were two taxidermists to take care of the
birdskins, bugs, mammals, etc., collected.</p>

<p>Of the four hunters, who, with Captain
Kleinschmidt, financed the expedition, three
were from Philadelphia: Scull, our polyglot
interpreter, a publisher of books; Collins, a
manufacturer; and Lovering, a young man
who had lived part of his life in Wyoming.
The fourth, Dr. Elting, was a surgeon of
reputation from Albany, N. Y. All were
experienced hunters, Scull and Collins having
followed trails in Africa and America, Dr.
Elting in the Western States and Canada,
and Lovering in the West. As for myself,
the guest without responsibility or care,
"taken along," as the captain said, "to lend
dignity to the expedition," you can call me
by my common names: "The Sour-dough
Preacher," "The Mushing Parson," "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Alaska Sky-Pilot," or any of half a dozen
Northwestern cognomens, of all of which
I am equally proud.</p>

<p>My object in joining this expedition was,
first, to have a big hunt and a grand rest.
But, more than the outing, I valued the
privilege of exploring ground untrodden by
the missionary, and, if possible, doing
something towards bringing the Gospel to the
heathen Eskimo of the Alaskan and Siberian
shores.</p>

<p>We were all "out for a lark," glad beyond
expression to be hundreds of miles
from a telegram or newspaper, to be able to
wear our dirty clothes and eat in our
shirtsleeves without shame; to forget that such
things existed as automobiles or stiff collars
or dinner parties. We had four months of
a royal good time&mdash;along the Asiatic Coast
after Siberian sheep, on the Alaska Peninsula
for caribou and brown bears, on Kenai
Peninsula after moose, white sheep and
black bear, among the islands of the Southern
Alaska Coast and Bering Sea with the
bird and seal rookeries, and pursuing polar
bear amid the ice-floes of the Arctic Ocean.</p>

<p>We visited many Eskimo villages; we
shot for the museums hundreds of varieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of birds on the Siberian and Alaskan Coasts;
we captured new species of beetles, moths,
butterflies and other insects; the camera
fiends and moving-picture man reveled in
novel scenes, animate and inanimate. We
buffeted storms, pounded ice and sailed
sunny seas.</p>

<p>But the climax of our joyous outing was
the three or four days we spent among the
walrus herds off the Northern Siberian
Coast. Scull and Collins, who had hunted
everything in Africa from dikdik to rhinoceros,
declared that none of their experiences
in that continent approached in thrilling
interest their days with the walrus herds.</p>

<p>For the walrus is <em>sui generis</em>: there is no
other mammal at all like him in appearance,
habits, habitat or characteristics. He is the
least known or written about of all the
larger animals. No thorough study has ever
been made of him. More is known of the
habits of the extinct woolly elephant&mdash;the
mammoth, whose bones, tusks, and even
hair and skin we find on the Alaskan Coast&mdash;than
the walrus. And what has been written
and the common ideas concerning this
animal are so erroneous as to be funny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>A century or so ago a naturalist-traveler,
writing about the Eskimos and the <em>morse</em>,
as the walrus was then called, said that the
tusks of the animal are for the purpose of
pulling himself up the icy mountains where
he lives; that his habit is to thus work his
way up to the top of the dizziest peak; that
the Eskimos pursue him there and cut
holes through the thick skin of his flippers
unknown to the huge pachyderm, whose
hide is impervious to sensation. Then,
having passed strong ropes through these
holes and tied them to the jutting crags,
they raise a hullabaloo, and the walrus,
alarmed, precipitating himself down the
mountain, jerks off his skin, which the
Eskimos then use in the construction of
their boats and houses. The year before
our hunt, a California gentleman, interested
in Captain K.'s moving pictures, asked him
whether the walrus brought forth their
young alive or laid eggs and hatched them.</p>

<p>In May, 1913, when discussing my proposed
outing with some of my ministerial
brethren, at the General Assembly at Atlanta,
a good Doctor of Divinity tried to
deter me from undertaking it because of its
dangerous character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is it not true, Dr. Young," he asked
with great solicitude, "that the walrus sometimes
devours human flesh?"</p>

<p>I patiently explained that the walrus has
no incisors, no teeth at all but flat grinders,
level with the gums and far back in the jaws,
"and therefore he cannot rend or eat anything
so very tough as a missionary"; and
that moreover his mouth is situated back
of a narrow opening of three or four inches
in width between his tusks, so that nothing
bulky can enter it. "He might drown me
but he couldn't eat me!"</p>

<p>The "D. D." listened with open skepticism
and put this poser: "How then can he
devour his prey?"</p>

<p>"What prey?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, the seals and salmon and other
large sea animals on which he feeds."</p>

<p>Again I sternly suppressed my rising emotions:
"But he doesn't eat these things.
He couldn't catch them and doesn't want
them. He is only a clam-eater. His tusks
are not spears, but an admirably constructed
clam-hoe. He could not live without them;
and his stiff whiskers form a fine brush to
clean the clams of mud before he dines off
them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The good brother glanced from one to
another of the listening group with a look
that plainly said: "How sad it is that such
shameless prevaricators will even slip into
the ministry;" and walked off muttering
something about consulting "authorities."</p>

<p>Illustrating my own roving habits, while
a pioneer missionary in Alaska, I have sometimes
said, using a common simile, that I
"had no more home than a jack-rabbit." I
am changing this now to a stronger
expression; "no more home than a walrus."
He is the most constantly on the move of
all the vagabonds. Even when sleeping he
is moving, for the only home the poor fellow
has is the ice-cakes which form in the Arctic
Ocean and Bering Sea, entirely filling the
former and in the winter crowding down the
latter to about fifty-eight degrees, north
latitude. The walrus herds, for the greater
part of the year, keep on the borders of this
great field of ice. In the summer when the
Bering Sea ice melts and also that of the
southern part of the Arctic Ocean, the walrus
keeps on the flat ice-cakes which float
over the great clam beds of these shallow
seas. As the ice forms in the fall and the
ice-floes extend southward he sets out on a
long swim ahead of the fast freezing ice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
resting occasionally on the Siberian shore,
the Diomedes, St. Lawrence, St. Matthews
and other islands. When the ice-field has
extended to its southern limit he resumes his
ice-house-boat habit and returns north in
the spring.</p>

<p>So little is known of the life history of
the walrus that I am unable to speak with
confidence, but the young are evidently
brought forth very early in the spring, April
or May, and float with their mothers (the
females and young herding together), up
into the Arctic Ocean as far as the shoals
off Wrangle Island, one hundred and fifty
miles north of the Siberian Coast. There
the little ones are guarded by the cows,
which during the summer months are the
only really dangerous walrus ever met with.
Were the walrus the ferocious and combatant
animal he is sometimes depicted, it
would be a risky thing indeed to hunt him
in skin boats or any other small craft.
Imagine three or four tons of muscular
fierceness, armed with strong, sharp, spearlike
tusks, charging at you. The front part
of his head is a solid mass of tough bone
more than a foot thick. He could strike his
tusks through your boat and sink it in an instant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
or hook them over the edge and upset
you, spearing you one by one in the water.</p>

<p>But the huge pachyderm is the most timid
and good-natured of animals. It is only
when the female fears for the safety of her
young that she shows anything like ferocity.
In 1911 Captain Kleinschmidt was taking
moving pictures of the walrus herds. He
had two catamarans, made by lashing two
kyaks together with firm cross pieces. In
the foremost craft two Eskimo hunters with
their spears were paddling ahead, to slip up
on the herds and harpoon them at the proper
time, while the moving-picture man was in
the other craft to take pictures of the herds
and of the whole performance.</p>

<p>A herd of cows and their young had been
frightened from an ice-cake into the water.
Suddenly one of these cows thrust her tusks
forward, the sign of a charge: "Look out!"
cried K. to the Eskimo as the cow dived.
They made frantic efforts to paddle their
kyaks to the nearest berg, but the cow came
up under the craft and slashed with her
tusks one of the kyaks, ripping the bottom
and filling it with water. The other kyak
of the catamaran tilted dangerously, the
Eskimo in the sinking one throwing himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
upon it, and the two frightened natives made
their escape to the ice-cake. Coming to
the surface again the cow sighted Captain
K.'s catamaran, thrust her tusks forward
again and dived; he saw her body deep in
the water coming toward him and thought
his time had come; but luckily when she
struck the canoe had veered and received
only a glancing blow. She came to the surface
within a yard of the picture man, who
had his rifle ready and thrust it against her
brain and pulled the trigger, which ended
that affair. But it was a perilous adventure,
and one is liable to meet with such if he is
so rash as to venture among the herds of the
cows with their young.</p>

<p>During this hunt of ours, although we saw
great herds aggregating hundreds of walrus,
we did not see a cow or calf among
them; only the big bulls herded together
and occasionally a solitary one.</p>

<p>After passing Cape Prince of Wales into
the Arctic Ocean we had a week of battling
with winds and tide before we got into the
ice-pack well up towards Wrangell and
Herald Islands. We had another week of
pounding ice, poking through the narrow
"leads," constantly turning and running the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
other way in our effort to get to the shores
where the walrus herds would feed.</p>

<p>We had fun with the polar bears, but,
with one exception, saw no walrus for nearly
two weeks of this strenuous fight. This one
exception was a big old bull that we
sighted reposing in solitary dignity on an
ice-cake in the midst of this vast white
solitude.</p>

<p>Captain K. took Dr. Elting with him in
the kyaks which we manufactured into a
catamaran, and while the <em>Abler</em> lay "off and
on" the two hunters whom we watched
through our field-glasses made their sinuous
way behind ice hummocks through the
narrow "leads" and around the jamming
cakes of the ice-field. We saw them at last
seemingly right upon the walrus, on the
same cake. The big fellow was fast asleep
in the uneasy fashion that all walrus and
seal have of sleeping; that is, every two or
three minutes they will raise their heads and
move them back and forth, during which
time the hunters must keep perfectly still
and if possible behind the ice-cakes. The
walrus, however, has not the keen sight of
the seal, and is more easily approached.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Our hunters moored their skin boat on the
ice-cake close to the walrus, crept up behind
a hummock right upon him, and Dr. Elting
put his bullet into the brain of the beast,
which is situated in his neck, and not in
what appears to be his head. It was an
easy and not very exciting triumph. What
possessed this old bull to lie there alone
scores of miles from his companions, I do
not know. He may have been there two or
three weeks on that one ice-cake, as the
Eskimos tell us this is sometimes their
habit.</p>

<p>It was not until August eighteenth that
we got sight of our first walrus herd, and
then for three days we were right in the
midst of them. We had been driven by
buffeting winds and threatening ice-packs
away from the vicinity of the islands far
westward along the Siberian coast and were
perhaps thirty or forty miles from land.
The cry was raised from the "crow's nest":
"Walrus!"</p>

<p>The appearance of the herd as we
approached it was very unlike anything
imagined by those who had not hitherto
seen these animals. All sorts of comparisons
crowd upon one's imagination when
trying to describe them. Some of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
look like huge caterpillars and have an exactly
similar motion, except that their
antennæ are bent downward instead of upward.
Sometimes when bunched up they
look like immense squirrels. Sometimes
when scratching themselves with their
flippers they have the languid movements
of a fashionable lady fanning herself; and
again, when two are sparring at each other,
they have the fierce mien of gladiators.
But always there is that particularly comical
edge about them that impels to irresistible
laughter, as when one approaches a cage of
monkeys. Their attitudes and motions are
so unexpected and ridiculous.</p>

<p>I did little hunting myself but went with
the other hunters in the <em>oomiak</em> or large skin
boat; and I believe I got more enjoyment
than any one else of the party; for I was not
doing the killing, and was enjoying equally
the misses and the hits of the others and,
above all, the study of these huge and
interesting brutes. Many of my preconceived
notions, obtained by reading and by hearsay,
were put to flight during those three or four
days.</p>

<p>Only a few years ago a report to the
Smithsonian Institute was published in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
which it was stated that the walrus were
very watchful and wary, and that when reposing
on the ice-cake they selected a large
bull to climb the highest pinnacle and keep
watch for foes, and that when he grew
weary of his vigil and wished to sleep he
would prod the bull next to him with his
tusks and let him take his turn while the
former watchman took a nap. It was thus
inferred that the walrus scanned the region
of ice with eagle eyes and had a system of
signalling similar to the organized human
gunboats or armies.</p>

<p>But this is all nonsense. The fact is that
the walrus cannot see more than ten or
twelve feet at the most, and even at that
distance I doubt whether he can distinguish
more than the mere outlines of any object.
His eyes are the eyes of a fish, small and
rudely constructed and exceptionally
nearsighted. They are made for use in the dim
depths of the sea. When the sun shines the
walrus shut their eyes and apparently cannot
open them. When alarmed they rush into the
water and then come up and will crowd within
five or six feet of the moving-picture
man or hunter, bulging their eyes
like those of a crab in frantic attempts to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
see their foe.</p>

<p>We clad ourselves in white muslin parkas,
and got our <em>oomiaks</em> or <em>kyaks</em> boldly up under
the noses of these great beasts with them
staring down upon us. The only thing we
had to guard against was their getting our
wind. If we kept to leeward of them we
were always out of their sight. The strange
bulging of the eyes when excited gives a
most grotesque appearance to the countenance
of these walrus, as ordinarily their
eyes are deep sunken in their heads.</p>

<p>Let me sketch a picture from life: It is the
twentieth of August. We are in the vicinity
of Cape North on the Northern Siberian
coast. We are twenty or thirty miles offshore.
The day is warm, sunny, still. The
ship is tied to a large iceberg; a wilderness
of floating ice-cakes stretches in every direction
to the horizon. In some places these
are massed together; again there will be
little open places, and ragged leads, but
everywhere ice, ice, ice. And it is all in
motion; a slow heaving and grinding of the
floe, and the tidal currents moving in different
directions and with varied rapidity,
but all trending northwest, the landscape&mdash;or
seascape&mdash;changing every minute. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
are herds of walrus all around us, some
numerous, containing two or three hundred
on one cake of ice, others small; here a
group of four or five big bulls on a cake just
large enough to hold them; then fifteen or
twenty on a wider berg with little hummocks,
up the slopes of which the big brutes
crowd.</p>

<p>Scull and Lovering have taken the kyak-catamaran
and are paddling to the nearest
bunch of walrus not five hundred yards from
the ship. Captain K. has launched the big
skin boat, or <em>oomiak</em>, and is perched on the
high stern, steering. His aeroscope
moving-picture machine and graphlex camera,
his field-glass and rifle are by him. "Eskimo
Prank" and I are in front of him with our
paddles; while Dr. Elting and Collins are
in the bow, with paddles in their hands and
their big Ross and Mannlicher rifles close
by. We corkscrew our way through the
ice, steering past a bunch of walrus on a
small cake. "Small ice&mdash;lose um quick,"
says Prank. We are heading to a herd of
twenty or thirty, with some big tuskers
among them. We keep to the leeward of
them, for the sense of smell seems to be
their one keen sense, and even that does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
not compare in acuteness with the nose of
the polar bear or the caribou.</p>

<p>Captain K. and "Eskimo Prank" are the
only ones in our party who are perfectly
calm and unexcited, and they seem to the
rest of us rash and careless. The boat is
steered right in sight of the herd, and we
are getting close to them. Now the big,
ugly heads of five or six which have been
digging clams come up right alongside of
us. Suddenly their heads rise high out of
the water and their sunken eyes bulge out
as they stare up into our faces. It takes a
whole minute's scrutiny to satisfy them that
we are enemies, and they go down with
great splashing and blowing to come up
again almost in the same place and stare at
us again. So we are escorted up to the
edge of the ice-cake on which the herd
reposes. As a precaution against discovery
we list the <em>oomiak</em> so that its side protects us
from their sight.</p>

<p>We range alongside the cake; "Prank"
and I hold it steady by clutching spurs of
ice. The captain with his picture machines,
and the hunters with their guns crawl out on
the ice. They are clad in white parkas&mdash;but
there is plenty to see about them in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
conscience, and they make plenty of noise.
We are only twenty or thirty feet from the
nearest walrus. Two or three big bulls are
on the hummock right above us. The
captain and the hunters maneuver about,
cautiously but sometimes in plain sight, and
discuss, in voices clearly audible three times
the distance, the question as to which have
the best tusks, which lie most favorably for
a good shot, in which hump of the neck the
brain lies and just where to shoot. The
captain gets his bulky aeroscope placed and
sets the engine to buzzing and clacking.
The hunters are waiting for the beasts to
turn just right so as to expose the brain.
For the brain of a walrus is as small as that
of a rhinoceros in proportion to its size&mdash;about
as big as one's two fists,&mdash;and you
must know just where it is, and place your
ball right through it, or your game will flop
and flounder in his dying struggles and roll
into the sea and you'll lose him. Hence the
nervous care and uncertainty of the hunters.
For ten or fifteen minutes we wait for the
chance, the favorable moment.</p>

<p>But about that foolish sentinel story: A
beast that cannot tell an <em>oomiak</em> full of bipeds,
or these same bipeds with guns or cameras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
from a fellow walrus at the distance of ten
yards, doesn't plan and place a relay of
watchmen. We learned from close and long
observation that the walrus couldn't see us
in the sunshine&mdash;their eyes were shut, or
nearly so, and dim when open. Neither can
they hear well. They have no external ear
at all, only a tiny hole which requires close
observation to discover. Even the near
roar of a heavy rifle does not always alarm
them, and hunters with smaller rifles have
killed one after another of a whole herd until
all were slain, without causing a stampede.
Of course the repeated shots of two
or three rifles close at hand will generally
cause them to rush into the water, but even
that does not always scare them. A heavy
shot near by will bring all heads up, but if it
is not repeated they will soon go to sleep
again.</p>

<p>But what a thrilling time it was for me as
I sat in the boat or on the ice-cake and
watched the drama! It was far more
comedy than tragedy. The great beasts, as
heavy as elephants, were lying in bunches
or rolling around like a lot of huge, fat hogs.
Here a great bull with long tusks was lying
on his back and scratching himself against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
an ice hummock, wriggling and squirming
like a Newfoundland dog. Another was
curled up in an impossible heap and scratching
the top of his head with his hind flipper.
Another was making his way through a
bunch of sleeping comrades, rolling them
around or scrambling over them and fighting
those that resented his intrusion. Some
were swimming about the landing place of
low ice and trying to scramble onto the cake,
and these would disturb a whole bunch of
the lazy animals and there would be trouble.</p>

<p>And the noises they made were as various
and interesting as their positions. One huge
fellow, so close to me that I could have
punched him with a bamboo fishing-rod,
shook his head slowly from side to side with
shut eyes and groaned with a dismal falling
cadence, for all the world like a fat old man
with the rheumatism: "O-o-o-h: D-e-a-r me,
d-e-a-r me; this world's a wilderness of
woe!"</p>

<p>Another was optimistic, and his was a
sigh of infinite content. "A-a-h-h!" he said,
"what a nice, soft, warm bed this ice-cake
is! How fat and delicious those clams were!
And I don't believe there is one of those
horrible, malodorous little human bipeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
with his deadly bang-stick within a hundred
miles of us." And there we were within
twenty feet of him, trying to locate his
brain-pan!</p>

<p>Some grunted like pigs in sheer laziness.
Others barked sharply as they prodded each
other with their strong, sharp tusks: "Get
off my stomach, you lazy son of a clam-digger!
Wow! Wow!"</p>

<p>Two of them were sparring like gladiators,
raising their heads high and roaring defiance;
but it was all good nature, for in a
minute they were lying asleep, one with his
head across the other's neck.</p>

<p>All their movements, attitudes and voices
had such a droll element; all were so
irresistibly funny that I wanted to lie down on
my back and roar with laughter.</p>

<p>But our hunters wanted big heads and
tusks as trophies; our Eskimos desired some
hides to make their <em>oomiaks</em> and to cover
their houses; and we wanted tons of meat
for the women and children of the Siberian
villages. And so after a while the rifles
roared and roared again and again, and the
hunters moved close up, working their levers
fast. The mad scramble of the walrus for
the water was a most grotesque sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
They charged blindly ahead whichever way
they happened to be lying, humping up their
backs as they drew their hind flippers under
them and stretching out again, just like the
"woolly bear" caterpillars I used to tease
when a boy. Those that escaped the volley
splashed heavily into the water and dived
deep, but presently they were all at the surface
again, blowing and coughing, bunching
in masses, crowding close to the feet of the
moving-picture man, stretching their heads
six feet out of the water, popping and rolling
their ochre-colored eyes in frantic efforts to
see. Then one would get a whiff of the
dreaded man-scent and would go down with
a mighty splash and snort, and the whole
crowd would follow suit, soon to come up
and repeat the performance five or six times
before they could finally get it into their
slow brains that this was a dangerous
neighborhood.</p>

<p>We had four most interesting days among
the walrus, and the hunters were sated with
sport and trophies. My wishes were more
modest. I had announced to Dr. John
Timothy Stone, the Moderator of the
Atlanta General Assembly, 1913, that my
grand object in going on this hunt was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
kill a walrus myself, get his tusks and have
a couple of ivory gavels made out of them,
that I might present them to the outgoing
and incoming moderators of the next
General Assembly, which was to meet in
Chicago, 1914.</p>

<p>I got my walrus in this fashion: Captain
K., Dr. Elting and I were in the <em>oomiak</em> with
"Eskimo Prank." Dr. E. had got a fine
head, and we were cruising about, when
we spied a bunch of seven or eight big walrus
on a hummocky berg near the edge of
the ice-floe. The swell of the open ocean
came in here with considerable force, and
long, smooth topped billows heaved among
the ice-floes, washing far up on the shelving
bergs. We pushed our boat into a narrow
passage and the swell took it and landed the
bow on the ice right in the midst of the
walrus. The captain and the doctor took
the hazardous chance and leaped on the ice,
placing the muzzles of their rifles almost
against the heads of their selection. I was
not quick enough to make the jump, but as
the <em>oomiak</em> surged back with the receding
wave I saw a walrus charging down the
sloping ice diagonally from me. Both he
and I were moving rapidly and in opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
directions and I could only take a hasty
"wing" shot. It was the most difficult shot
of all my experience. I was standing
uncertainly in the plunging <em>oomiak</em>, swaying
and tottering as the light craft shot down
the receding wave away from the iceberg;
while the frightened walrus was humping
himself for all he was worth, trying
frantically to get off the ice-floe into the
ocean, his head bobbing up and down with his
rapid motion. I was wobbling in one direction
and he in another, and the space between us
was widening fast. There was no time to
be lost. Balancing most unsteadily, I swung
up my rifle for a snap shot. It was a great
moment. I had little hope of hitting the
mark; but my walrus fell to the crack of the
rifle, with his nose in the water. A delay of
one-tenth of a second and I would have lost
him. I had my gavels.</p>

<p>The closing scene of our walrus drama
was a comedy scene, and possessed what
every drama ought to have&mdash;human interest.
We had pounded our way southeast
again through the fast thickening ice-floe
driven upon us by a strong northwest wind.
At one time to the least experienced of the
party it seemed as if there was no possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
way out, as if we must spend the winter on
the bleak shore of Northern Siberia. But
always the narrow leads opened before us,
and after two or three days of slow and
careful work through the ice we emerged from
it, and before a strong, fair wind we bowled
along towards Bering Strait. The early
morning of August twenty-fifth found us
anchored in the harbor of East Cape, after
a hard struggle against wind and tide.</p>

<p>Here is a large Eskimo village. The
Tchukchees, or reindeer-herding Eskimos
do not roam as far north as this, and these
were the seal and walrus hunters. They
depend almost entirely for their food upon
the sea, and a shortage of these animals
sometimes causes starvation.</p>

<p>This village is situated behind a high
bluff, but it is not well sheltered, and a fierce
wind offshore caused the ship to tug violently
at her anchor, and made landing
difficult. Captain K. and the Eskimos got
a boat ashore and secured a stout line to the
ship. Then the eight or nine great carcases
on our deck were heaved by the donkey
engine into the sea. They would float by
this time. They were not spoiled at all in
the estimation of the Eskimo, only "ripe."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
They were tied to the line and then a large
crowd of Eskimos took hold, ran up the
beach and so towed the meat ashore.</p>

<p>Then, what a scene! Out from every
one of those large balloon-framed,
skin-covered houses poured the men, women and
children, shouting, screaming, hurrying in
joy and excitement. The men with high
waterproof mukluks were cutting up the
carcases, and men and women would seize
the hunks of meat and rush away to their
houses, pursued by scores of wolfish dogs
which leaped and snapped at the meat.
Occasionally the dogs would succeed in getting
away with a large chunk, when instantly
there would be a general mix-up from which
some of the dogs would emerge limping and
howling. There was a dog-fight every five
minutes.</p>

<p>The moving-picture man and the camera
fiends moved about "taking" the crowd.
The men with old ivory ornaments, white
ivory implements, and other curios to sell
besieged the white men. In all the houses
cooking was going on, and many were
chewing on the raw blubber. It was a day of
days to these poor people, and for the first
time on our voyage of pleasure we felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
ourselves benefactors to the human race. "The
calendar of these Eskimos will date from
to-day," said the only American white man
who lives in East Cape village. "They will
count time all winter from the day of the
big feed of walrus meat."</p>

<p>But better than the meat for their bodies
which we procured for these poor people of
the Arctic shore, was the Bread of Life that
I was able to direct to several Eskimo towns,
from the knowledge gained in this great
walrus hunt.</p>
